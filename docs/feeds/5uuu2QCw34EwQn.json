href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Venezuela</a>’s chief prosecutor has accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/el-salvador\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">El Salvador</a>’s president of being a “tyrannical” human trafficker after Nayib Bukele <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-prisoner-swap-venezuela\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">offered to exchange</a> the 252 Venezuelan migrants deported to his country’s prisons by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Donald Trump</a> for the same number of political prisoners in Venezuela.</p><p>Bukele made the offer on Sunday night in a message addressed directly to his authoritarian counterpart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Nicolás Maduro</a>. “I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number … of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,” El Salvador’s leader posted.</p><p>Hours later the proposal was rebuffed by one of Maduro’s top allies, the attorney general Tarek William Saab. In a televised address, Saab claimed the Salvadorian’s “cynical” offer exposed him as a narcissistic “neo-Nazi” who had “kidnapped” more than 250 Venezuelan migrants sent to a maximum-security jail in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/el-salvador\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">El Salvador</a> by the Trump administration since mid-March.</p><p>“Bukele is a serial human rights violator,” Saab said, pointing to the politician’s “horrifying” three-year anti-gang crackdown, which has seen at least 85,000 Salvadorians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/08/its-a-war-on-the-people-el-salvadora-mass-arrests-send-thousands-into-despair\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">thrown in jail, largely without due process</a>. Human rights activists say more than 360 prisoners have died.</p><p>Some members of Venezuela’s opposition – reeling from its failure to dislodge Maduro, despite seemingly beating him in last July’s presidential election – welcomed Bukele’s offer. Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader who lives in Spain, said the idea had his “full support”. The opposition’s most important leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/06/venezuelas-opposition-leader-calls-for-global-movement-to-rescue-country\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">María Corina Machado</a>, made no immediate comment.</p><p>However, many political and human rights activists have voiced perplexity and shock that the Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador – having been denied due process in the US and deported to an authoritarian foreign land – had become embroiled in the political tussle between strongman populists such as Trump, Bukele and Maduro.</p><p>“The idea that there would be a [prisoner] trade should be loathsome to anyone who actually cares about human rights,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.</p><p>Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, suspected the plight of the Venezuelans being held in El Salvador and Bukele’s prisoner swap “PR stunt” had potential benefits for both Bukele and Maduro.</p><p>“Maduro’s quite happy to feud with Bukele and point to human rights abuses in El Salvador as a way of distracting from the brutal repression and violence of his own regime,” Ramsey said. According to the human rights group Foro Penal, Maduro’s jails currently house about 900 political prisoners. Thousands were imprisoned after last year’s election when Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/08/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-contested-election-protests-detention\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">crackdown</a> to stop his apparent victor, Edmundo González, from taking power.</p><p>From Bukele’s perspective, offer was “a smart way of shifting the conversation away from concerns around the deportees being held in El Salvador back to the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela”, Ramsay said.</p><p>For the migrants caught up in the geopolitical jailings, the consequences are calamitous. Many have not been convicted of any crime and it is unclear how long they will be held.</p><p>In an interview last week, the wife of one Venezuelan prisoner, a singer called Arturo Suárez Trejo, lamented how the Venezuelan detainees seemed to have become part of a high-stakes game of chess. “And they are the pawns,” said Nathali Sánchez, rejecting claims that the father of her child was involved in crime. “It’s evil,” she added.</p><p>The Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan migrants – who it has accused, largely without evidence, of being gang members and terrorists – has put Venezuela’s opposition in a difficult spot.</p><p>Seemingly fearful of alienating Trump’s administration, its key leaders – including including Machado – have said little about the migration crackdown or the deportation of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador. “[The opposition has] largely held its tongue on issues of the treatment of fellow citizens because of its larger goal of gaining the White House’s support for its preferred strategy [to defeat Maduro] and that also is reprehensible,” Sabatini said.</p><p>Among the friends and families of the incarcerated migrants – many of them opposition supporters who fled Venezuela to escape Maduro’s regime – the opposition’s failure to defend them is causing anger and frustration.</p><p>“The reality is that the Venezuelan opposition needs to have a good relationship with the White House, and they understand that they can’t be perceived as criticizing Trump,” said Ramsey. “But on the other hand, the general public in Venezuela is outraged at the situation faced by those who’ve been deported and sent to this maximum security jail in El Salvador. So it really puts the opposition in between a rock and a hard place.”</p>","contentLength":5134,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1k4odvp/venezuela_accuses_el_salvador_of_human/"},{"title":"KBW CEO: Four big banks shouldn’t control 40% of deposits","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho-5ZisZAP0","date":1745268342,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":511,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\"I don't think we should measure the success of the banking industry by how many banks we have.

The trigger was France’s support for Morocco’s claims of sovereignty over Western Sahara – a resource-rich territory, considered by the United Nations as ‘non-autonomous’. It is controlled, for the most part, by Morocco but claimed by the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi independence movement supported by Algeria. The move infuriated Algiers, which announced the “withdrawal with immediate effect” of its ambassador to France.<b>A wider anti-France sentiment</b><p>\nBut Algeria is not the only country that has been undoing its relations with France.</p><p>\nOn 19 March Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali decided to leave the international Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), an organisation established by countries united by the French language, </p><a href=\"https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2025/03/25/mali-burkina-faso-and-niger-withdraw-from-international-organization-of-la-francophonie/\" target=\"_new\">alleging</a> that the OIF has become France’s “remote-controlled political instrument” operated from Paris to suit its “geopolitical considerations”.<p>\nAsked whether other African countries might follow Algeria in replacing the French language with English at its universities, Rosemary Salomone, a professor of law at the United States-based John’s University, said: “The situation in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali is somewhat unique in that these are all countries that have been taken over by military juntas who are now buttressed by Russian mercenaries.”</p><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-rise-of-english-9780190625610?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#\" target=\"_new\">book</a>, <i>The Rise of English: Global politics and the power of language</i>, added: “They not only have left the OIF, they have all demoted French from an official to a working language, demanded that all French troops leave their respective countries, and begun dismantling traces of colonialism, including street names and monuments.<p>\n“These countries are now thrown into chaos so the possibility of their resetting language policy in higher education is highly unlikely. That said, France is clearly losing its foothold in its former French colonies in Africa,” Salomone pointed out.</p><p>\nAccording to her, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire have also terminated France’s military presence amid popular cries for sovereignty and decolonisation. This could lead to their eventually moving toward English in their universities for both anti-French and pragmatic reasons.</p><b>French a ‘lost language’?</b><p>\nAlgerian Professor Sadallah Boubaker-Khaled from the </p> in Algiers, Algeria, told : “French has become a lost language” that is not used in many French educational institutions in former colonies where French was the first language, including in universities.<p>\n“How can we use French in our universities at this time when even its speakers have become alienated from it?”</p><p>\nHe said young people had come to prefer studying in English because it “solves their educational and employment problems” to a greater extent than does French.</p><p>\n“English is now the dominant language in science, technology, economics and diplomacy. By integrating English into universities, Algeria is likely seeking to further open its students to the world and promote their competitiveness in the international job market and academic research,” Seyfallah said.</p><p>\nEchoing Seyfallah’s view, Salomone said changing to an English-based higher educational system would ease the way for Algeria to create the human capital for attracting multinational corporations, prepare students for the global economy where English is the dominant </p>, put Algeria in tune with technological advances internationally, and give the work of researchers greater visibility.<b>A gradual approach needed</b><p>\nBut Seyfallah pointed out that, while English was gaining ground among the youth, especially online, the overall level of English proficiency among university students and professors was not high enough to switch entirely from French to English – especially in technical and scientific fields where precise terminology was key.</p><a href=\"https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/\" target=\"_new\">Education First English Proficiency Index</a>, Algeria is ranked 78 out of 116 countries worldwide and is classified as having “low English proficiency”.<p>\n“The main challenges Algerian universities will face are low English proficiency, the lack of English educational resources, teacher resistance or unpreparedness and inequalities between institutions and cultural and identity resistance,” Seyfallah said.</p><p>\n“Honestly, there’s a lot that Algerian universities need to do to successfully prepare for such a major transition. If I had to sum it up, I’d say they need to take a gradual, well-supported and inclusive approach,” Seyfallah suggested.</p><p>\nSalomone added that, while the Algerian government had now mandated English language classes beginning in the primary grades, the question remains as to whether students entering university have gained the necessary skills in academic English.</p><p>\n“Just as concerning is whether Algeria has a sufficient number of faculty members prepared to teach in English. Building that level of linguistic infrastructure takes years of intensive language training.</p><p>\n“One way to address the problem is to test all students entering the university and provide intense English language classes (perhaps over the summer and continuing into the academic year) for those who do not meet a threshold of competence across language skills, including reading, writing and listening comprehension.”</p><p>\nAccording to Salomone, the same could be done for faculty members and administrators.</p><p>\n“Universities might also consider, at least initially, hiring visiting faculty from anglophone countries or initiating faculty exchange programmes with anglophone countries,” she said.\n</p>","contentLength":7198,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1k4kapl/algeria_drops_french_adopts_english_as_university/"},{"title":"After seizing control of the US government, the Heritage Foundation turns its attention to the EU","url":"https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/politics/right-wing-push-to-dismantle-the-eu-heritage-foundations-private-workshop/","date":1745255338,"author":"/u/Morgentau7","guid":504,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>A private workshop took place on 11 March 2025 in Washington DC, hosted by the </strong><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heritage-Foundation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\"></a><strong>, to discuss proposals by European right-wing lobby groups to dismantle the European Union and the European Court of Justice.</strong></p><p>The Heritage Foundation, authors of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"\">Project 2025</a> – which is seen by many as the blueprint for the policies being enacted by the current Trump administration – welcomed right-wing thinktanks and lobby groups from Hungary and Poland.

However, the EU, a project still under construction, should have the capacity to create solutions.</p><p>In this vein, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) pledged to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the survival of European Monetary Union (EMU), and he did. Several non-conventional monetary policy measures were implemented to address not only the risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation, but also to tackle the euro sovereign debt crisis. Purchases of government bonds by the ECB was also justified to ensure price stability in the euro area, since a currency can only be stable if its continued existence is not in doubt (Asmussen, 2013).</p><p>In May 2010, the ECB announced the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), whose main target consisted of lowering the interest rates of euro members in financial distress. It resulted in ECB purchases of government bonds in the secondary markets, and thus in an increase of those countries bonds’ prices. According to some commentators, by doing so the ECB would have intervened in the market forces (Helm, 2012). Later, in July 2012, the Governing Council of the ECB announced the Outright Monetary Transactions Programme (OMT). In spite of its technical features, their critics claimed that the ECB had breached its mandate by announcing potentially unlimited sovereign bond purchases. For some authors, by implementing the OMT Programme the ECB had exceeded monetary measures marks and interfered into the terrain of fiscal policy. This would have resulted in a violation of Art. 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), according to which monetary financing of sovereign entities is strictly prohibited. Additionally, they claim that political independence of the ECB could have been put in danger. In the same way, the German Federal Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht or BVerfG), putting into doubt the legality of the OMT, decided to refer for the first time a case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The BVerfG’s judgment strongly implied that the OMT program was an act of economic policy, therefore outside the monetary mandate of the ECB, because of its objective, the selectivity of the potential purchases and the risk to compromise the functioning of European Stability Mechanism (ESM). (Pennesi, 2016). In the aftermath of these disputes, in March 2015 the Eurosystem started buying government bonds under a new mechanism, the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), which to the current date is still in place.</p><p>However, unconventional monetary policy has not been the only solution tabled to solve the European sovereign crisis:</p><p>On the one hand, since the euro zone was conceived as a monetary union without a fiscal union, it has been proposed to achieve a much deeper fiscal integration among euro members. This would imply an extended government budget at the EU level, combined with an EU tax system (Fuest and Peichl, 2012), and the creation of a European finance minister (EU-FM), (Enderlein and Haas, 2015). Others consider that an extension of the fiscal powers of «Brussels» would be politically unacceptable, since it would put at risk the democratic principle of <i>no taxation without representation</i>.</p><p>On the other hand, some economists claimed that an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent member estate, as well as a fiscal insurance mechanism were indispensable to protect taxpayers in other euro zone, in the event of debt restructuring (Dolls et al., 2016).</p><p>Finally, the German Council of Economic Experts proposed the European Redemption Pact (ERP) as an alternative strategy for exiting from the EU debt crisis. This pact would include a binding commitment by all participating countries to bring public debt ratios below the reference value of 60% within the next 20 to 25 years. To ensure that this objective might be reached with realistic primary balances, participating countries could transfer their debt exceeding this threshold into a redemption fund for which participating member countries were jointly and severally liable (German Council of Economic Expert, 2011; Parello and Visco, 2012; and Doluca et al., 2012).</p><p><strong>2. The Eurobonds as an alternative tool</strong></p><p>An alternative solution (compatible with the existence of a fiscal union) would consist of pooling some fiscal risks. Unifying national debts and creating Eurobonds have been viewed as a tool for not only boosting integration and the efficiency of financial markets in the euro area, but also as a potentially powerful instrument to solve the European sovereign debt crisis.</p><p>According to its standard design, this debt instrument could be issued by a newly created common European Fiscal Authority or European Debt Management Agency, and would be jointly and severally backed by all countries members of the euro zone. However, this design has not been unique. Multiple Eurobond designs have been proposed: EMU Fund Bonds (Boonstra, 2005 and 2011); Financial Stability Fund Bonds (Gros and Micossi, 2008); European Investment Bank Bonds (De Grauwe and Moesen, 2009); European Monetary Fund Bonds (Mayer, 2009); Blue-Red Bonds(Delpha and Von Weizsäcker, 2010); European Debt Agency Bonds (Tremonti and Juncker, 2010); European Safe Bonds or ESBies (Brunnermeier et al., 2012); Synthetic Eurobonds (Beck et al., 2011); Trichet Bonds (Economides and Smith, 2011); Eurobills (Hellwig and Philippon, 2011 and Bishop, 2013); Partial Insured Sovereign Bond (Dübel, 2011); Revised Blue Bonds (Gopal and Pasche, 2012); and Structured Eurobonds (Hild et al., 2012). Note that these designs greatly differ in their scope, goals, tenor of the debt, level of intergovernmental commitment, extent of solidarity, degree of legal and institutional obstacles, as well as the feasibility of implementation roadmaps.</p><p>Important institutional and legal obstacles have become apparent to make progress in the direction of creating a European common bond but in this brief note, we focus in particular on the economic advantages and drawbacks of introducing such instrument.</p><p><strong>2.1. Advantages of introducing Eurobonds</strong></p><p>Many reports have been published on the possible pooling of sovereign issuance in the euro area and there is a widespread consensus that the introduction of a common supranational Eurobond would imply several merits. The following have been particularly highlighted:</p><ol type=\"a\"><li>A tool to resolve the eurozone debt crisis. Eurobond is a mechanism to buy time by reducing the degree to which heavily indebted countries need to apply short-term austerity measures. Implementing such a common public debt in the EU area could reduce risks of recession and facilitate faster economic growth for the whole region.</li><li>A way of stopping speculative attacks. Sometimes, psychological fears that certain member states are or may become insolvent, initiate inefficient speculative attacks: the markets demand a risk premium that raises the cost of refinancing these bonds and depresses their prices, generating a sovereign debt crisis. The introduction of Eurobonds might contribute to break this loop.</li><li>A method to reduce public debt yields of those member estates in financial stress. Due to the higher liquidity and ease of trading of Eurobonds, investors and traders would be willing to accept lower yields. By reducing interest payments governments could reduce their future budget deficits. As a result, public debt sustainability would improve in the euro-zone.</li></ol><p>In addition, a number of merits arising from introducing European common bonds have been stood out in connection with financial issues:</p><ol type=\"a\"><li>Mitigating bank-sovereign crisis loop. Historically, banks and sovereigns have been indissolubly tied together. The vicious cycle between banking and sovereign crisis has been a salient feature of the recent eurozone crisis. The conversion of euro area national debts into a common eurozone debt would benefit the banks in Europe, break this strong interdependence and help put a stop to the banking crisis.</li><li>Creating a new safe asset. Due to its increased depth, breadth and liquidity, investors would increase their demand of Eurobonds for investment and precautionary purposes, just as they presently do with US Treasuries. Thus, the introduction of Eurobonds would generate a seigniorage effect in the euro zone.</li><li>A deeper public debt market in Europe. The creation of Eurobonds would transform the currently fragmented European capital market for sovereign bonds into one single and vast European Government bond market.</li><li>Solidifying the euro as a global reserve asset. The creation of a single debt instrument traded in a vast market could reinforce the euro as a means of payment instrument, and as currency for official store of value purposes (a reserve currency that central banks choose to hold their savings in).</li></ol><p><strong>2.2. Drawbacks arising from the introduction of Eurobonds</strong></p><p>So far, governments in the euro area are individually responsible for the debt they have issued. According to the no bail-out clause (Art. 125 of the TFEU) it is prohibited for the EU or any of the national governments to assume responsibility for the debt issued by another member state (Pisani-Ferry, 2012). Thus, the creation of some type of Eurobonds could require a reform in the TFEU, but beyond this legal obstacle, there also some economic problems that introducing Eurobonds might mean for the Eurozone. A wide academic literature exist on disadvantages of pooling fiscal risks in a scenario in which public sector debt ratios are very different by country:</p><ol type=\"a\"><li>Adverse selection. The introduction of Eurobonds might raise the interest rates at which the most creditworthy euro members currently pay on their debt. This could lead to a rejection of Eurobonds by highly solvent countries, but this refusal to participate would imply the uselessness of the Eurobond mechanism itself.</li><li>Free riding. A model of fiscal risk pooling could force the more frugal countries to start paying for prodigal countries’ deficits. Fiscally prudent members might be penalized for other members’ dissipation. If in this scenario, currently very solvent countries change its fiscal policy profile, gradually over time, eurozone countries could face the raise the debt-GDP ratio for the entire region, resulting in undesired credit rating cuts and increases in debt yields.</li><li>Moral hazard. It relates to the fear that countries’ “bad” behavior in overspending and accumulating debt would be rewarded through a government bailout. The introduction of Eurobonds might reduce incentives to perform fiscal austerity policies in the future. If highly indebted countries were rescued, their fiscal policy behavior would tend to be more lax. Moreover, if governments with high public debt ratios may finance themselves at low yields the incentives to carry out budget discipline measures vanish. It would foster the illusion that is possible for a country to get out of financial difficulties without undertaken fundamental reforms.</li><li>Losing signaling role of financial markets. Issuing Eurobonds would remove the disciplining effect of capital markets on the ability of member states to issue more debt.</li><li>Fiscal sovereignty loss. Previous fiscal constraints, that are required for a proper functioning of a joint issuance mechanism, would eliminate each country’s ability to control its interest cost burden and would reduce its sovereignty in fiscal matters.</li><li>Loss of liquidity at the national public debt markets. If the Eurobond market is to be added to the existing national public debt markets, instead of substituting them, the opposite effect to the wished might occur. We could witness an increase in the level of market fragmentation, as well as a loss of liquidity at the national public debt markets with respect to the current situation.</li></ol><p>Designers of European common debt systems have proposed alternative mechanisms aimed at restoring the disciplinary role of the market within the euro zone following the introduction of the Eurobonds. Avoiding the effect of free riding problems arising from the introduction of Eurobonds implies finding a way to ensure that one country’s profligacy will not spill over to another country’s debt burden; and therefore, ensuring that member states assume the responsibilities of their own fiscal policies. Moreover, introducing European common debt issuances will require finding a way to neutralize the moral hazard problem within the euro zone, and to internalize the signalling and disciplining force of the market. In short, to succeed the introduction of Eurobonds would require to enshrine fiscal discipline in a fair and credible way, as well as creating the right incentives for countries to maintain debt ratios at manageable levels.</p><p>Beck, T., Uhlig, H., and Wagner, W.

The prime minister stood firm, and as the Covid-19 virus forced the country into prolonged lockdown, protests diminished and Babiš’s position seemed more assured, despite widespread discontent over his handling of the pandemic.</p><p>Yet in 2021 parliamentary elections, Babiš and his lavishly funded party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/czech-pm-set-to-lose-power-after-weak-showing-in-general-election\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">were defeated by a five-party coalition</a> whose ideological differences were superseded by their hostility toward the prime minister.</p><p>The demonstrations, despite the lost momentum caused by Covid and Babiš’s stubborn refusal to resign even as police lodged criminal fraud charges, had worked by converting discontent into votes at the ballot box.</p><p>“We certainly had some role in the election results,” said Benjamin Roll, Million Moments for Democracy’s spokesperson and deputy leader at the time. “I believe we in the Czech Republic are an example of how long-term civic-society activities can bring, or help bring, political change.</p><p>“Those protests gave us all the feeling we have the power, that we were not alone, and we can do something. I think this emotion is really crucial.”</p><p>It is a potentially decisive factor amid swirling debate about how to respond to Trump as he has smashed long-established norms and assailed institutions at breakneck speed since his inauguration on 20 January.</p><p>While the leftwing Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York representative, have attracted vast crowds on their Fighting Oligarchy road tour that seems to emphasize the value of popular dissent, other Democrats have adopted a less confrontational approach, with some opting not to fight Trump at every turn.</p><p>The party’s leader in the senate, Chuck Schumer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/glenn-ivey-chuck-schumer-republican-funding-bill\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">drew fire</a> from many on his own side for leading a group of fellow Democratic senators in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/chuck-schumer-democrats-funding-bill\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">voting for</a> a six-month Republican funding bill last month, averting a government shutdown.</p><p>The move sharpened criticism that congressional Democrats had reacted too passively to Trump’s authoritarian power grabs.</p><p>At the same time, the party’s exclusion from power in the White House and on Capitol Hill has prompted questions over the effectiveness of mass protests. The failure of demonstrations to translate into electoral defeat for authoritarian-type leaders in some countries – Hungary, Turkey and Serbia are recently cited examples – has fed such doubts.</p><p>However, Steven Levitsky, a politics professor at Harvard University and a specialist on authoritarian threats to democracy, said dismissing mass rallies as futile – which he called “a new conventional wisdom” after years of thinking they guaranteed a dictator’s downfall – was misplaced.</p><p>“Mass protest is less likely to bring down a government in a place where elections are a viable channel, meaning where it is still a democracy or near-democracy,” he said. “Protest is not going to lead to Donald Trump’s resignation, or Orbán’s, but that doesn’t mean it’s not relevant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Protest</a> can weaken the government, can shape public opinion and the media framing and discourse, which is very important.”</p><p>At the “Hands Off” rally in Washington DC on 5 April, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/trump-hands-off-protest\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">drew tens of thousands</a> of people, participants said one aim was to embolden reticent voters and Trump critics who might be intimidated by the president’s blustering tactics.</p><p>Jiří Pehe, a Czech political analyst who is the director of New York University in Prague, said that message had its echoes in the Czech precedent.</p><p>“It was this overall, this strategy of waking people up and telling them: ‘Look, you have agency. You can change things. You are not just passive observers of what’s going on, but you can change things, but you have to be active,’” he said.</p><p>But allowing millions of dissatisfied Americans simply to vent their frustrations would not be enough, Pehe warned. “If the Czech Republic is to be an example, these demonstrations need to happen again and again across the United States and they need to have one or two strong messages. There has to be a very strong message towards the political class because only it can actually change things. And in this case, there should be pressure on the Democrats, saying: ‘Look, it’s your task to stop Donald Trump.’”</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian at the 5 April Washington rally, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top member of the House judiciary committee, said “a popular resistance strategy” featuring protests could only work in harness with “an effective legislative strategy”, a tall order since the Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p><p>“Ultimately, we’re going to have to win the elections next year, and when we take back the House and the Senate, we will be back in the driver’s seat,” he said.</p><p>That aim evokes another lesson from the Czech example, observers say: the need for the Democrats to take their cue from the demonstrators and put aside their ideological differences for the sake of unity.</p><p>“What you’ve seen in the Czech Republic is a broad array of political forces coming together to form a pro-democracy coalition and I think that’s instructive for the US,” said Norm Eisen, a former US ambassador to Prague and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who called for a “big tent” approach encompassing anti-Trump Republicans.</p><p>“They were for putting aside particular differences on partisan issues, on ideology. That is one of the critical ingredients for success, and I believe we are seeing that here. In these deportation disputes, we filed a brief at the supreme court by more than three dozen conservatives, [who served in] every Republican presidential administration, from Nixon to Trump 1, and I was the lawyer on that, together with a senior justice department official from the Bush administration.”</p><p>Levitsky said the US protests had assumed outsize importance given the failure of other institutions and pillars of the establishment – including major CEOs, law firms, the Catholic church and, until this week, universities – to mount a stand since Trump took office.</p><p>“This emerging protest movement, and the size of the crowds at the Bernie Sanders and AOC events, is going to compel Democratic politicians to become more active, follow their base rather than so as not to lose it,” he said. “What the protest movement can do is contribute to an erosion of Trump’s popularity, and embolden opposition politicians and probably contribute to an electoral outcome in a couple years.</p><p>“In that sense, these guys are not wasting their time. I think it’s a very, very important step in getting the opposition off the sidelines.”</p><p>Back in Prague, Roll – recalling the intoxication of the anti-Babiš rallies – had advice for US demonstrators: stay positive and, whatever Trump’s provocations, avoid hateful rhetoric – something he fears the US’s two-party system makes hard to avoid.</p><p>“The division in the United States is really dangerous because you see the other side as the enemy,” he said. “It’s crucial to remain non-violent and hopeful. Talking in front of lots of people, we realised you have to be careful about your language because if you are too negative or hateful, it can defeat your purpose. Remember that the other side are people. They’re your brothers and sisters.”</p>","contentLength":9305,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k49cfi/antitrump_protesters_in_the_us_might_look_to_the/"},{"title":"Pope Francis Dies: His Unique Approach to Leading the Catholic Church | WSJ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMfh0b4nsOE","date":1745225422,"author":"The Wall Street Journal","guid":565,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Pope Francis was known for refocusing the Catholic Church on promoting social and economic justice rather than traditional moral teachings.

If there is alignment between Kyiv, Washington, and European allies, the proposals could be formally introduced to Moscow.</p><p>Among the most controversial elements is the suggestion that the <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/united-states/\">U.S.</a> could formally recognize Russia’s illegal annexation of <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/crimea/\">Crimea</a>. Additionally, Ukrainian accession to NATO would be ruled out under the current proposal. </p><p>\"NATO isn’t on the table,\" said U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/keith-kellogg/\">Keith Kellogg</a> in an interview with Fox News on April 20.</p><p>Ukraine has previously said it <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-recognize/\">would not recognize </a>occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal. The move to recognize Crimea under Russian rule also contradicts a decade-long bipartisan consensus in Washington and international law.</p><p>In 2018, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed U.S. opposition to the annexation, calling it a threat to \"a bedrock international principle shared by democratic states: that no country can change the borders of another by force.\" The U.S. Congress has also passed legislation opposing any recognition of Russia’s claim over Crimea.</p><p>Ukraine has also previously <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-on-negotiations/\">rejected</a> restrictions on joining international alliances and organizations—namely, NATO and the EU—as part of a potential peace deal. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently said that Kyiv's path toward membership remains \"irreversible\" but added that the matter would not be part of an eventual peace settlement.</p><p>The Ukrainian delegation in Paris included Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. According to the WSJ, the Trump team, including Kellogg and special envoy Steve Witkoff, should be present at the London meeting as well.</p><p>Witkoff is then expected to travel to Moscow, the WSJ reported. Officially the special envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has led Trump's diplomatic outreach to Russia, meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin three times, most <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/putin-witkoff-discuss-aspects-of-ukrainian-settlement-kremlin-says/\">recently on April 11</a>.</p><p>In a comment to the WSJ, a senior State Department official emphasized that the ideas were presented as \"potential options\" rather than ultimatums, though Kyiv is expected to offer a firm stance quickly.</p><p>Another proposal would involve establishing a neutral zone around the Russian-occupied <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant/\">Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant</a>, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, potentially leaving it under American control.</p><p>In an earlier <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5u7YYEoHFmDZjedKQ0eoG0mDFDYD0otSfqCo5W8xqg/edit?tab=t.0\">call</a> with Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suggested the idea of the U.S. acquiring Ukrainian energy assets, which he said could be the \"best protection for that infrastructure.\"</p><p>While the U.S. proposals stop short of granting Russia formal legal recognition of its claimed annexation of four partially occupied eastern Ukrainian regions, they also do not call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from those areas. </p><p>\nSince 2022, Moscow has illegally declared Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of the Russian Federation, incorporating them into its Constitution and demanding the complete retreat of Ukrainian forces from their administrative borders.</p><p>The Trump administration has not ruled out bilateral military assistance to Ukraine or support for European nations contributing forces to a \"reassurance force,\" a potential buffer against future aggression. However, no specific security guarantees have yet been offered as part of the proposed deal.</p><p>This goes in contrast with Russian demands for a full halt of military support to Ukraine, which the Kremlin voiced as a precondition to a 30-day <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/ceasefire/\">ceasefire</a> suggested by the Trump administration over a month ago. While <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> has accepted the offer if <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/\">Russia</a> reciprocates, Moscow has not yet supported the idea.

If a weapon is subject to Itar, it cannot be built, sold or supplied to someone else, without US consent and support.</p><p>Trump’s tariff war, suspension of military and <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/us-suspends-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-fn3nc0bjx\">intelligence aid to Ukraine</a> and threats to Canada and Denmark have made British and European countries concerned about relying on US defence equipment in the future.</p><p>155mm rounds are currently used by the British Army in its Archer self-propelled howitzer and the AS-90 armoured self-propelled artillery.</p><p>BAE Systems is the only company in the UK to produce the 155mm rounds and much of the ammunition has been given to Ukraine, leaving the UK dangerously short.</p><p>Steve Cardew, the business development director at BAE Systems’ Maritime and Land Defence Solutions, said: “The whole challenge for our industry is around production scale up and creating enough industrial capacity to effectively match Russia and other hostile nations.”</p><p>In an interview with The Times, he explained that RDX explosives used in 155mm rounds, mortars and warheads were normally developed in a relatively inefficient large-scale facility, however European nations were struggling to produce explosives at scale.</p><p>Under the plans outlined by BAE, each individual shipping container will produce up to 100 tonnes a year of explosives on a much smaller scale but one that is more efficient, cheaper and quicker. It is also more resilient in terms of security, he explained. “One large facility is clearly a big security threat. If you have dispersed facilities, it is much more secure.”</p><p>The innovative technology the firm has developed, using automation, has been proven as a concept and BAE now plans to manufacture its own explosives at scale. The system will then be sold to other countries so they can also produce their own sovereign explosives.</p><p>At the moment, 155mm rounds or weapons produced with explosive material from the US are subject to Itar restrictions. Cardew said that in future BAE would be able to sell its products on the basis they are “Itar-free”.</p><p>He said the “global security scenario” had “forced” BAE to accelerate the development of its explosives work in an environment where there was more demand for munitions globally than there was the industrial base to supply it.</p><p>“Making sure we have our own access to our own supply chains is really important. We clearly have enough supply chain access for what we have today but going forward, continuing to rely on that will generate risk and therefore we are keen to make sure that the UK has its own supply chain,” he said.</p><p>Asked about concerns over Trump’s erratic behaviour, he said: “What is going on in the US is clearly one facet of a general view we have got that the world is becoming increasingly unstable and therefore we need to protect ourselves and our supply chain accordingly. I don’t think it is just about the US.”</p><p>He said the need for such unique technology was at an “all time high” and had “tremendous potential”.</p><p>Every day <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/topic/russia\">Russia</a> is firing about 12,000 rounds, compared with around 7,000 fired by the Ukrainians, according to Ukrainian military sources. Six plants in North Korea are now supplying Moscow with its ammunition, amounting to some 45 per cent of Russia’s needs, two sources said.</p><p>BAE will deliver the 16-fold increase in 155mm rounds when its new explosive filling facility at Glascoed, south Wales, becomes operational this summer.</p>","contentLength":5423,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k47s7m/britain_to_ramp_up_explosives_production_to_end/"}],"tags":["news"]}
