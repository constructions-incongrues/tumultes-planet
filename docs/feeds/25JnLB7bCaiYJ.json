The Guardian reports: A Soyuz capsule carrying the American and two Russian cosmonauts landed in Kazakhstan on Sunday, Pettit's birthday. \"Today at 0420 Moscow time (0120 GMT), the Soyuz MS-26 landing craft with Alexei Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and Donald (Don) Pettit aboard landed near the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan,\" Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.\n \nSpending 220 days in space, Pettit, Ovchinin and Vagner orbited the Earth 3,520 times and completed a journey of 93.3m miles over the course of their mission. It was the fourth spaceflight for Pettit, who has logged more than 18 months in orbit during his 29-year career. Nasa said in a statement that Pettit was \"doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth.\" A recording of the touchdown can be viewed here.\n \nEarlier this year, Pettit managed to take one of the best photos ever captured from space. \"When I first saw it, I was dazzled by its beauty,\" wrote Ars Technica's Eric Berger. \"But when I looked further into the image, there were just so many amazing details to be found.\"\n \n\"In this image, one can see the core of the Milky Way galaxy, zodiacal light (sunlight diffused by interplanetary dust), streaks of SpaceX Starlink satellites, individual stars, an edge-on view of the atmosphere that appears in burnt umber due to hydroxide emissions, a near-sunrise just over the horizon, and nighttime cities appearing as streaks.\"","contentLength":1569,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Quest To Build Islands With Ocean Currents In the Maldives","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2056255/the-quest-to-build-islands-with-ocean-currents-in-the-maldives?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1745292600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":254,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review: Arete Glacier Initiative has raised $5 million to improve forecasts of sea-level rise and explore the possibility of refreezing glaciers in place.\nOff one atoll, just south of the Maldives' capital, Male, researchers are testing one way to capture sand in strategic locations -- to grow islands, rebuild beaches, and protect coastal communities from sea-level rise. Swim 10 minutes out into the En'boodhoofinolhu Lagoon and you'll find the Ramp Ring, an unusual structure made up of six tough-skinned geotextile bladders. These submerged bags, part of a recent effort called the Growing Islands project, form a pair of parentheses separated by 90meters (around 300 feet). The bags, each about two meters tall, were deployed in December 2024, and by February, underwater images showed that sand had climbed about a meter and a half up the surface of each one, demonstrating how passive structures can quickly replenish beaches and, in time, build a solid foundation for new land. \"There's just a ton of sand in there. It's really looking good,\" says Skylar Tibbits, an architect and founder of the MIT Self-Assembly Lab, which is developing the project in partnership with the Male-based climate tech company Invena.\n \nThe Self-Assembly Lab designs material technologies that can be programmed to transform or \"self-assemble\" in the air or underwater, exploiting natural forces like gravity, wind, waves, and sunlight. Its creations include sheets of wood fiber that form into three-dimensional structures when splashed with water, which the researchers hope could be used for tool-free flat-pack furniture.Growing Islands is their largest-scale undertaking yet. Since 2017, the project has deployed 10 experiments in the Maldives, testing different materials, locations, and strategies, including inflatable structures and mesh nets. The Ramp Ring is many times larger than previous deployments and aims to overcome their biggest limitation.\n \nIn the Maldives, the direction of the currents changes with the seasons. Past experiments have been able to capture only one seasonal flow, meaning they lie dormant for months of the year. By contrast, the Ramp Ring is \"omnidirectional,\" capturing sand year-round. \"It's basically a big ring, a big loop, and no matter which monsoon season and which wave direction, it accumulates sand in the same area,\" Tibbits says. The approach points to a more sustainable way to protect the archipelago, whose growing population is supported by an economy that caters to 2 million annual tourists drawn by its white beaches and teeming coral reefs. Most of the country's 187 inhabited islands have already had some form of human intervention to reclaim land or defend against erosion, such as concrete blocks, jetties, and breakwaters.","contentLength":2832,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Hallucinations Lead To a New Cyber Threat: Slopsquatting","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/04/22/0118200/ai-hallucinations-lead-to-a-new-cyber-threat-slopsquatting?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1745286000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":253,"unread":true,"content":"Researchers have uncovered a new supply chain attack called Slopsquatting, where threat actors exploit hallucinated, non-existent package names generated by AI coding tools like GPT-4 and CodeLlama. These believable yet fake packages, representing almost 20% of the samples tested, can be registered by attackers to distribute malicious code. CSO Online reports: Slopsquatting, as researchers are calling it, is a term first coined by Seth Larson, a security developer-in-residence at Python Software Foundation (PSF), for its resemblance to the typosquatting technique. Instead of relying on a user's mistake, as in typosquats, threat actors rely on an AI model's mistake. A significant number of packages, amounting to 19.7% (205,000 packages), recommended in test samples were found to be fakes. Open-source models -- like DeepSeek and WizardCoder -- hallucinated more frequently, at 21.7% on average, compared to the commercial ones (5.2%) like GPT 4. Researchers found CodeLlama ( hallucinating over a third of the outputs) to be the worst offender, and GPT-4 Turbo ( just 3.59% hallucinations) to be the best performer.\n \nThese package hallucinations are particularly dangerous as they were found to be persistent, repetitive, and believable. When researchers reran 500 prompts that had previously produced hallucinated packages, 43% of hallucinations reappeared every time in 10 successive re-runs, with 58% of them appearing in more than one run. The study concluded that this persistence indicates \"that the majority of hallucinations are not just random noise, but repeatable artifacts of how the models respond to certain prompts.\" This increases their value to attackers, it added. Additionally, these hallucinated package names were observed to be \"semantically convincing.\" Thirty-eight percent of them had moderate string similarity to real packages, suggesting a similar naming structure. \"Only 13% of hallucinations were simple off-by-one typos,\" Socket added.

The battery manufacturer also introduced a sodium-ion battery called Naxtra, offering up to 500km range for EVs and potential to diversify global energy resources. The Financial Times reports: The claims by the Chinese battery groups would put them ahead of major western rivals. At present, Tesla vehicles can be charged up to 200 miles (321km) in added range in 15 minutes, while Germany's Mercedes-Benz recently launched its all-electric CLA compact sedan, which can be charged for up to 325km within 10 minutes using a fast-charging station.

When these drives reach the end of their useful lives, they are usually shredded, and the key materials they're made of -- including several rare earth elements (REE) -- end up as e-waste. At the same time, countries are mining these same materials and emitting a lot of greenhouse gases in the process. And China, a major source of REE, recently announced export restrictions on seven of them, potentially limiting the U.S. tech industry's access to materials such as dysprosium, which is necessary for magnetic storage, motors, and generators.\n \n[On Thursday], Western Digital announced that it has created a large-scale hard disk drive recycling program in concert with Microsoft and recycling-industry partners CMR (Critical Materials Recycling) and PedalPoint Recycling. The new process reclaims Rare Earth Oxides (REO) containing dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium from hard drives, along with aluminum, steel, gold, palladium, and copper. The REO reclamation takes place completely within the U.S. and those materials go back into the U.S. market.\n \nDubbed the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, WD's initiative has already saved 47,000 pounds worth of hard drives, SSDs, and caddies from landfills or less-effective recycling programs. WD was able to achieve a more than 90% reclaim rate for REE and an 80% rate for all of the shredded material. The drives came from Microsoft's U.S. data centers where they were first shredded and then sent to PedalPoint for sorting and processing. Magnets and steel were then sent to CMR, which uses its acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) technology to extract the rare earth elements.","contentLength":1830,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon Has Paused Some Data Center Lease Commitments, Wells Fargo Says","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2031221/amazon-has-paused-some-data-center-lease-commitments-wells-fargo-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1745274000,"author":"msmash","guid":248,"unread":true,"content":"Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies' spending plans.

These initiatives, including the Digital Bangladesh program (ICT Policy 2009), Smart Bangladesh (ICT Master Plan 2041), and National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2024, focus on harnessing the global digital revolution to kickstart technological innovation and digital transformation in Bangladesh.</p><p>\\\n<strong>However, the core of Bangladesh’s efforts to shape its digital future relies primarily on Bangladesh’s ability to truly harness its renewable energy sector.</strong> Despite its ambitious plans, power problems continue to plague Bangladesh, especially in the country’s growth-stage , where demand for energy far outpaces supply. In fact, Bangladesh experienced power outages for over 30% of all of 2022, highlighting the desperate need for Bangladesh to grow its energy supply.</p><blockquote><p><strong>As Bangladesh moves toward a more digitally-driven economy, addressing its energy challenges becomes critical, not only for ensuring infrastructure sovereignty, but also for safeguarding its digital sovereignty.</strong></p></blockquote><h3><em>Renewable energy investment</em></h3><p>Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of power demand growth globally, resulting in a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, with  of its power generation coming from natural gas, while coal usage continues to increase as a source of electricity. Additionally, Bangladesh’s usage of coal will most likely increase as coal prices continue to fall due to reduced demand, increased coal supply, and shifts among developed nations to renewable energy, among a variety of other factors. As a result, Bangladesh needs to grow its renewable energy industry to plan for less dependency on harmful energy sources like natural gas and coal.</p><p>\\\nBangladesh’s efforts to grow its renewable energy sector have resulted in a significant need for foreign direct investment in its energy sector. China has played a  in Bangladesh-specific investments in renewable energy, with a focus on solar energy.  saw the announcement of a 100MW solar plant to be built by a joint venture between China's CREC International Renewable Energy Company and Bangladesh's state-owned B-R Powergen Limited (BRPL). Around the same time, a venture led by the Chinese firm Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company (BCRECL) resulted in the commissioning of the 68MW Sirajganj Solar Park. Additionally, China’s Huadian Corporation signed an agreement in mid-2024 to develop a solar facility with projected power production of 160MW.</p><p>\\\n also saw the beginning of operations for the 60MW Cox’s Bazar wind plant, noted as “the first centralized wind power project in Bangladesh invested and constructed by Chinese enterprises.” The BCRECL has also taken efforts to establish a 50MW wind power plant in Payra.</p><p>\\\nChinese investment in Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector continues to build, with notable Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi announcing its interest in Bangladesh-specific investments in March 2025. This visit built on a previous visit in late 2024 featuring LONGi and Tongwei Co., Ltd., another Chinese-based solar manufacturer, with both these trade delegations highlighting the increasing interest for Chinese firms and investors in controlling Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector.</p><h3><em>Investments in physical infrastructure</em></h3><p>China’s involvement in Bangladesh extends beyond renewable energy, with China being a major player in financing and constructing critical infrastructure in Bangladesh, including ports, bridges, and power plants. As of mid-2024, China accounted for 27 power projects in Bangladesh, with the coal-fired Payra power plant, generating an impressive 1,320 MW of power, being built as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>\\\nChina has played a large role in developing and constructing crucial infrastructure in Bangladesh, ranging from ports to special economic zones (SEZs). Bangladesh’s Mongla port, its second largest port, received a loan of $400 million for modernization efforts on . Bangladesh’s largest port, Chittagong port, alongside the Payra port, both of significant strategic importance in the Indian Ocean, were both constructed by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), building on China’s strategy of establishing a crucial presence at strategic maritime centers throughout the globe. Additionally, the planned Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone,  as the “first industrial zone in Bangladesh invested, developed, and operated by a Chinese company,” has gained immense investment traction and acceleration in recent months, particularly given a bilateral meeting between leaders Muhammad Yunis and Xi Jinping in Beijing on March 28, 2025.</p><p>\\\nChina has also been a major source of financing, construction, and technical assistance in terms of bridge infrastructure in Bangladesh. The Padma bridge, a 6.15km bridge built at a cost of nearly $4 billion, was constructed by Chinese SOE China Major Bridge Engineering Company. As of , China was building over 20 bridges in Bangladesh, with over 650 companies investing into the country during the same period, with Chinese loans totalling just over $2.33 billion this time.</p><h3><em>Need for digital infrastructure sovereignty</em></h3><p>Assuming Bangladesh can resolve its domestic power generation issues with clean energy controlled by Bangladesh interests, it must also take its digital infrastructure sovereignty into consideration as Bangladesh develops its digital economy.</p><p>\\\nIn the same vein, Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure is already seeing growing dependencies on Chinese firms and investment. In December 2024, Huawei announced efforts to bolster Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure development, notably co-launching an innovation lab with the Bangladesh government and establishing a China-Bangladesh fintech exchange program. Mid-2024 also saw Bangladesh’s former Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu lauding China’s technology innovation in telecommunications, e-commerce, green energy, and agriculture, and much more.</p><p>\\\nThese efforts build on Huawei’s , alongside other Chinese technology giants like ZTE, in growing Bangladesh's digital industry, with key  including 5G, enterprise cloud solutions, and much more. The Chinese government has also played a large role in advancing Bangladesh's technology development, completing a joint project in late 2022 to connect 2,600 government offices in a move to solidify national connectivity.</p><p>In conclusion, Bangladesh's pursuit of a digital economy hinges on its ability to address critical challenges in energy infrastructure, with a focus on developing its renewable energy sources. With power shortages continuing to hinder growth, investing in clean sustainable energy is paramount for the nation’s digital transformation.</p><p>\\\nWhile Chinese investments in energy, infrastructure, and digital technology have accelerated progress, they also highlight the need for Bangladesh to carefully manage its long-term energy and digital sovereignty.</p><p>\\n If it is able to secure a sustainable energy future, Bangladesh can effectively harness its full potential to develop its digital economy while maintaining its digital infrastructure sovereignty, enabling it to emerge as a competitive player in the global digital economy.</p><p>\\\n<em>Image courtesy of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</em></p>","contentLength":7481,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Flipkart to relocate HQ to India ahead of IPO","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/flipkart-to-relocate-hq-to-india-ahead-of-ipo/","date":1745263458,"author":"Jagmeet Singh","guid":173,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Flipkart, the Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce startup that closely fights Amazon in the South Asian market, is preparing to shift its headquarters back to India from Singapore as the company prepares to file for an IPO on Indian stock exchanges.

It’s also how bugs get deployed, contracts go wrong, and systems fail.</p><p>The human cost of faulty AI decisions is already here: people getting denied healthcare coverage, flagged as fraudulent, or jailed based on algorithmic predictions. In these cases, the true danger isn’t just the AI — it’s the uncritical acceptance of its output.</p><p>When you delegate a decision to a system you don’t understand and don’t check, you’ve surrendered agency. Worse: you’ve surrendered accountability.</p><p>\"The algorithm said so\" becomes a shield. But it shouldn’t be.</p><p>Delegation isn’t inherently bad. But you have to make it conscious.

After a scaled-back plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve missed the mark with market sentiment, what’s next for the world’s most famous cryptocurrency?</p><p>\\\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way. All indications pointed to a Bitcoin bull run throughout the first half of 2025. Buoyed by what should be a post-halving event rally alongside the high-profile approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in early 2024, many speculative crypto enthusiasts expected BTC to be performing far better today.</p><p>\\\nThe return of Trump to the White House represented the first time a pro-crypto President had taken office, and his campaign pledge of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was a catalyst for widespread optimism.</p><p>\\\nBetween election day on November 5, 2024, and Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, Bitcoin had rallied an astonishing 58.22%, underlining the confidence that investors had in the incoming President and his plans for crypto.</p><p>\\\nSince the inauguration, BTC has fallen by more than 20%. With external factors like Wall Street volatility amid trade tariff uncertainty pushing crypto markets lower, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which monitors the market sentiment towards the cryptocurrency, : ‘extreme fear.’</p><p>\\\nWhat’s changed? It appears that optimism was simply too high for the changes investors anticipated.</p><p>One key source of investor confidence in BTC stemmed from the expectation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve being established by the President. On March 7, an  for a Bitcoin ‘Fort Knox’ was finally signed, but it wasn’t what crypto enthusiasts expected.</p><p>\\\nThe executive order focused on establishing a cryptocurrency reserve comprising of the 198,000 BTC the American government had seized through law enforcement confiscations, worth an estimated $17 billion.</p><p>\\\nTrump’s crypto tsar David Sacks also confirmed that  would be stockpiled, and that these reserves will also be comprised of assets forfeited in criminal proceedings.</p><p>\\\nBecause the reserve would be built using seized assets,  that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would “not cost taxpayers a dime.” However, with  from $90,000 to $84,600 before a slight rebound in the wake of the announcement, some investors wouldn’t share the same outlook.</p><p>\\\nThe issue with the executive order is that it falls short of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’s terms as initially laid out in the Bitcoin Act.</p><p>\\\n“Under the so-called Bitcoin Act, the US must accumulate 1 million bitcoins within 20 years, with the goal of owning roughly 5% of the total supply,” explained Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “Coupled with huge demand from ETF funds, this could create a strong supply-demand imbalance, against this backdrop there are various expectations for the price of BTC”.</p><p>\\\nBecause the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, investors expected that the US topping up their reserve of BTC to 1 million would significantly increase the asset’s scarcity and drive its value higher.</p><p>\\\nIt now appears that this won’t be the case. It also appears evident that Trump’s unpredictability is creating disruptive swings in sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market as a whole.</p><h2>The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?</h2><p>2025 was supposed to be the year where the cryptocurrency bull market resumed regardless of who was in office. Bitcoin’s cyclical nature, which is powered by its halving events every four years, has historically driven the entire market higher as the coin’s scarcity ramps up overnight.</p><p>\\\nBitcoin halving events occur because a  halves the volume of BTC distributed to its miners every four years. This is a deflationary tool that slows the rate of production for the coin and instantly makes it more scarce.</p><p>\\\nEvery halving event since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 has culminated in a bull market and fresh all-time high that’s considerably stronger than previous post-halving highs. Although January 2025 saw BTC trading at a fresh high of $108,786, expectations among investors were for the coin to climb higher this year.</p><p>\\\nTellingly, Bitcoin’s fall from its most recent all-time high came in the wake of the launch of $MELANIA, an official meme token for incoming First Lady, Melania Trump. With  of the token reportedly belonging to just 10 people, investors became fearful of a cash grab.</p><p>\\\nHaving launched $TRUMP as a meme coin just three days earlier, the meme tokens contributed to a loss of investor confidence that still hasn’t recovered, judging by Bitcoin’s consistent losses in the wake of the event.</p><p>\\\nTrump’s outspoken approach to the Presidency has created more volatility not only in the cryptocurrency markets but also on Wall Street. The announcements and delays to tariffs and unprecedented new policies have carried a significant impact on sentiment-driven markets, and considering that there are few investment options that are more influenced by sentiment than crypto, these disruptions to Bitcoin’s historical cycles may bring an end to the last predictable trend within the ecosystem.</p><p>Bitcoin, and the wider cryptocurrency market have correlated strongly with Wall Street in recent months. This is perhaps a logical result of aligning both markets with the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, it also means that Trump and Wall Street’s influence on the crypto market is going to weigh heavily on Bitcoin.</p><p>\\\nAt this stage, it’s important to reiterate that Trump is the most crypto-positive President we’ve seen enter the White House yet, and there’s plenty of room for his pro-growth stance to pay off for Bitcoin.</p><p>\\\nHowever, in a landscape where Bitcoin’s cycles have a weakening influence, 2025 may shape up to be a challenging year for a cryptocurrency market that had so much expectation pinned upon it moving into the new year.</p>","contentLength":5944,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"PHNX Materials found a way to decarbonize concrete using dirty coal waste","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/phnx-materials-found-a-way-to-decarbonize-concrete-using-dirty-coal-waste/","date":1745257279,"author":"Tim De Chant","guid":167,"unread":true,"content":"<article>PHNX Materials has devised a way to strip fly ash of sulfur and aluminum, impurities that concrete companies would rather avoid.</article>","contentLength":128,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Google Faces Off With US Government in Attempt To Break Up Company in Search Monopoly Case","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/1736226/google-faces-off-with-us-government-in-attempt-to-break-up-company-in-search-monopoly-case?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1745256960,"author":"msmash","guid":242,"unread":true,"content":"Google is confronting an existential threat as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into an illegal monopoly.

In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. \"This is a moment in time, we're at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations,\" said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. \n\nThe proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \"remedy hearing,\" are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google's attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government's heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn't boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology. \"Google won its place in the market fair and square,\" Schmidtlein said.","contentLength":1655,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GCC Patch Revived For -mtune=generic Showing Nice Benefits On Intel & AMD CPUs","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/GCC-Inline-Memset-Memcpy-Gen","date":1745256382,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":678,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A 2021 era patch for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) has been revived and discussed in recent days around simplifying the memcpy and memset inlining strategies when compiling code with the \"-mtune=generic\" option.

As lenders integrate advanced data analytics and machine learning into their operations, the traditional barriers in student lending—inefficiency, bias, and inflexible loan structures—are beginning to dissolve.</p><p>\\\nAI promises to streamline internal processes, personalize financial solutions for individual borrowers, improve fraud detection, and make lending more accessible to historically underserved populations.</p><p>\\\nAI is transforming every private student loan lifecycle phase—from underwriting to loan servicing. Students must explore the challenges, ethical concerns, and future outlook for them and lenders alike.</p><h2><strong>AI-Enhanced Risk Assessment: Moving Beyond Credit Scores</strong></h2><p>In traditional lending models, credit scores and financial history have long dictated access to capital. This has placed younger borrowers, particularly students with thin or no credit files, at a disadvantage. AI, however, offers a new approach. AI can create a fuller picture of a borrower's future repayment ability by analyzing alternative data points such as academic records, school rankings, degree completion rates, and projected income by field of study.</p><p>\\\nMachine learning algorithms can predict risk for thin-file consumers by analyzing a broader range of data. These models more accurately assess an individual's likelihood of defaulting on a loan, aiding lenders in making informed decisions about extending credit. This evolution helps to identify capable borrowers who may otherwise be overlooked, thereby expanding access to fair financing.</p><p>\\\n​Upstart's AI-driven underwriting model has significantly enhanced credit accessibility and affordability compared to traditional methods. According to Upstart's , their model approves 43 percent more applicants overall, with an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 33 percent lower.</p><p>\\\nNotably, the model has a pronounced positive impact on minority applicants. Such results highlight the potential of AI to promote financial inclusion by extending more favorable credit terms to a broader and more diverse applicant pool.​</p><p>\\\nThese innovations suggest the potential for greater inclusion in the education lending space, especially for non-traditional borrowers.</p><h2><strong>Streamlining Loan Servicing Through Intelligent Automation</strong></h2><p>Once a loan is approved, it is crucial for lenders and borrowers to manage it efficiently. AI is increasingly used to streamline loan servicing by automating repetitive tasks, reducing human error, and lowering operational costs. This includes AI-powered chatbots that handle borrower inquiries 24/7, predictive tools that flag potential delinquencies, and dynamic repayment systems that offer tailored assistance.</p><p>\\\nLenders adopting AI and automation tools could reduce operational costs while increasing borrower satisfaction through faster, more accurate responses. These savings may be passed on to borrowers through lower interest rates or financial incentives.</p><p>\\\nAI can detect early signs of financial hardship, offering borrowers preemptive support options such as temporary forbearance, modified repayment plans, or personalized financial counseling. These AI-powered interventions promote healthier repayment outcomes and reduce defaults—an increasingly important metric as student debt levels climb.</p><h2><strong>Fighting Fraud with Real-Time AI Monitoring</strong></h2><p>As the digital footprint of financial transactions expands, so does the risk of fraud. In the private student loan market, fraudulent applications—such as falsified school enrollment or identity theft—can result in significant losses. AI's strength in identifying patterns and outliers allows it to detect suspicious activity faster and more accurately than traditional systems.</p><p>\\\nFor example, modern fraud detection tools leverage machine learning to scan vast amounts of application data for anomalies such as duplicate documents, inconsistencies in personal information, and IP address mismatches.</p><p>\\\nBy deploying these technologies, private student lenders can bolster trust and ensure that legitimate borrowers are protected in a secure financial ecosystem.</p><h2><strong>Personalization: The AI Advantage in Loan Terms and Rewards</strong></h2><p>AI improves backend efficiency and transforms the borrower experience through hyper-personalization. By analyzing individual data profiles, AI systems can adjust loan terms dynamically, offering customized repayment schedules, targeted interest rates, and even performance-based incentives.</p><p>\\\nAI can dynamically adjust loan offers, repayment terms, and even incentives by modeling borrower-specific risk profiles and financial behaviors.</p><p>\\\nStudents seeking a more flexible and transparent  experience are increasingly turning to lenders like SoFi, where AI enables features like tailored interest rates, autopay discounts (typically 0.25 percent), and suitable grade rewards for maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or higher.</p><p>\\\nSuch personalization ensures that students are not bound to rigid, one-size-fits-all terms. Instead, they benefit from financial products that evolve with their academic and economic circumstances—offering access to education and support throughout the journey.</p><h2><strong>Strategic Use of AI Across the Borrowing Lifecycle</strong></h2><p>Today’s advanced fintech companies can lead the way in AI integration across multiple financial products. Beyond student loans, these companies employ AI for robo-advising, credit decisions, and member engagement. Their data models help identify high-potential borrowers, manage risks dynamically, and offer proactive financial advice to users across multiple channels.</p><p>\\\nComprehensive platforms also use predictive analytics to tailor communications, recommending products or actions based on a borrower's past behavior. For instance, a borrower nearing graduation may receive automated refinancing suggestions, while someone demonstrating repayment stress could be offered hardship support before a default occurs.</p><p>\\\nThis proactive and data-driven approach is a model for the next generation of private lenders—where personalization, automation, and financial wellness converge into a seamless digital experience.</p><h2><strong>Addressing Ethical Concerns: Bias, Transparency, and Data Privacy</strong></h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the lending industry, offering enhanced efficiency and broader access to credit. However, its integration brings forth critical ethical and regulatory considerations that must be thoroughly addressed to ensure fairness and compliance.​</p><h3>Data Privacy Regulations: GDPR and FERPA</h3><p>Using alternative data in AI-driven lending necessitates stringent adherence to data privacy laws. In the United States, the broadly encompassing  (the Family Educational Rights &amp; Privacy Act) covers the privacy of students' education records, ensuring that personally identifiable information is safeguarded and not disclosed without consent.</p><p>\\\nLenders must navigate these regulations carefully, ensuring that borrowers are fully informed about how their data is collected, used, and protected.​</p><h3>Addressing Algorithmic Bias</h3><p>A significant challenge in deploying AI systems is mitigating algorithmic bias. AI models can inadvertently perpetuate existing prejudices in logged historical data, potentially leading to unfair treatment of applicants based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.</p><p>\\\nRecognizing this concern, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has emphasized that lenders are accountable for the AI technologies they employ.</p><h3><strong>Regulatory Guidance from the CFPB</strong></h3><p>To address these challenges, the CFPB has  requiring lenders to ensure their AI systems are transparent and comply with existing credit laws. In a circular released in 2023, the CFPB clarified that creditors must provide specific reasons for adverse actions, even when decisions are made using complex algorithms.</p><p>\\\nThe guidance states that creditors should be able to explain in detail their reasons for denial. The new guidance provides no special exemption for artificial intelligence. This directive mandates that lenders offer clear and understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing consumers to comprehend and, if necessary, challenge the outcomes.</p><h2><strong>A Glimpse Ahead: The Future of AI in Educational Lending</strong></h2><p>AI's influence on private student lending is expected to deepen. AI-powered financial advisors will help students understand the implications of various borrowing choices, while intelligent dashboards may predict repayment bottlenecks before they occur.</p><p>\\\nDynamic refinancing models are already emerging, with AI recalibrating interest rates based on evolving income trends and job stability. Blockchain-backed identity verification could streamline loan disbursement and reduce administrative burdens.</p><p>\\\nThese innovations point toward a more intelligent and student-centric lending environment—one that adapts in real time to borrower needs rather than imposing static expectations.</p><h2><strong>Toward a Smarter, Fairer Lending System</strong></h2><p>AI is not a panacea for the student debt crisis, but it is a powerful tool for making the lending system more transparent, equitable, and responsive. From more accurate risk assessments and proactive servicing to fraud protection and personalization, AI enables a future where private student loans are more efficient and human-centered.</p><p>\\\nWith thoughtful implementation, robust oversight, and continued innovation, integrating AI into private student loans offers a sustainable path forward—bridging gaps in access, reducing financial distress, and empowering the next generation of students to succeed.</p>","contentLength":9668,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"U.S. Pushes $900M for Small Modular Reactors","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states","date":1745251203,"author":"Shannon Cuthrell","guid":111,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A revamped Biden-era DOE program may not be enough to make SMRs a reality</p>","contentLength":73,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTkxMDg3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTMzNDk3Mn0.mWKYeRo65JUpgJYaR3YE6CWa51SYCXpKnzTSlMfan30/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/","date":1745250887,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","guid":163,"unread":true,"content":"<article>An&nbsp;AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record —&nbsp;the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

The arrival of the internet introduced the concept of cloud computing, transforming how businesses store, manage, and process data by enabling access to computing resources over the internet. Traditional cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud operate on a centralized model. These services rely on large data centers owned and managed by a single entity, with inherent barriers (challenges) like security vulnerabilities, censorship, and less control over data.</p><h2>Traditional Cloud Barriers</h2><p>Centralized cloud models, with their innovation, are vulnerable to single points of failure, where a data center outage can disrupt all users. They also raise significant concerns about data privacy and security, as users must trust the provider with sensitive information. Additionally, businesses often face vendor lock-in, making it costly and complex to switch providers due to compatibility issues and data migration challenges. With the emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized cloud emerges as a viable alternative for cloud computing and storage that sets businesses free from barriers.</p><p>\\\nDecentralized cloud computing differs by distributing computational resources, data storage, and services across multiple decentralized nodes, often powered by blockchain technology. This approach creates a more secure, transparent, and user-centric infrastructure that addresses the drawbacks of traditional cloud (centralized models).</p><blockquote><p>Decentralized cloud leverages on peer-to-peer networks to enhance resilience, privacy, and cost effectiveness, to offer a promising edge for businesses seeking greater control over their data.</p></blockquote><h2>Why Decentralized Cloud: The Advantages</h2><p>Research shows that decentralized cloud computing offers several advantages over traditional cloud services, making it a better option for businesses and individuals. And here is the detailed breakdown of these benefits.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Enhanced Security and Privacy:</strong> Decentralized clouds distribute data across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches. Each piece of data is encrypted and stored in different locations, making it harder for attackers to access the datasets. Moreover, users retain control over their data, as they can encrypt it before it leaves their device, ensuring privacy. For example, platforms like Aleph Cloud implement client-side encryption, mitigating risks associated with centralized storage vulnerabilities such as malware and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Resilience and Reliability:</strong> With no single point of failure, decentralized clouds are more resilient to outages and cyber attacks. If one node goes down, the network continues to function using other nodes, which ensures uninterrupted service. This resilience is particularly valuable for businesses reliant on continuous operations.</p><p>\\\n Decentralized clouds are more affordable and efficient, especially for smaller businesses. By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, businesses can use underutilized computing resources from other participants, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure. For instance, smaller companies often find centralized cloud fees, like AWS's $23 monthly charge for data center storage, as burdensome, whereas decentralized cloud providers like Aleph Cloud offer a more democratic pricing model.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Decentralized clouds scale more easily by adding more nodes to the network, accommodating fluctuating demand without the constraints of centralized infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial for applications with variable workloads, such as AI and machine learning, in comparison with centralized models.</p><p>\\\n With a decentralized cloud, individual users can monetize their computing resources by becoming node operators, creating a more inclusive ecosystem. This democratization allows individuals to earn rewards for contributing resources and promoting a community-driven approach.</p><p>\\\nThese advantages position decentralized cloud computing as a compelling alternative, particularly for businesses seeking to mitigate the risks and barriers associated with centralized cloud. Several projects are already at the forefront of decentralized cloud, demonstrating its practical applications and benefits. Among them is Aleph Cloud, offering decentralized compute and storage solutions that address the limitations of centralized cloud barriers.</p><h2>Understanding Aleph Cloud: The Web3 Supercloud</h2><p>Aleph Cloud is a decentralized cloud platform that provides on-demand serverless computation, database, and storage infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Aleph Cloud leverages a two-layered architecture, comprising Core Channel Nodes (CCNs) and Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs). CCNs ensure security, process transactions, store data, and enable cross-chain communication, while CRNs provide computational power and data storage to ensure efficient task distribution. Unlike others that focus on static storage, Aleph Cloud handles data that needs real-time updates, making it ideal for dynamic applications. Aleph Cloud supercloud currently supports 24 chains for builders to seamlessly leverage Aleph Cloud innovation.</p><p>:::info\nAleph Cloud is like a decentralized AWS for Web3, which provides serverless computing, dynamic storage, and databases through a network of nodes rather than one company's servers.</p><h3>Aleph Cloud Key features: Real World Usage</h3><p>Aleph Cloud powers dynamic NFT metadata for blockchain-based games, notably through a partnership with Ubisoft. Since 2021, Ubisoft has run a Core Channel Node on Aleph Cloud to manage NFT metadata for games like Champions Tactics and Captain Laserhawk.

Dubbed “Liberation Day,” Trump’s administration established a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with a massive tariff of up to 245% on some imports from China.</p><p>\\\nIn retaliation, China introduced its own measures that include curbs on the export of rare earth minerals and tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. Since the tariffs kicked off, trade between the biggest and second biggest economy in the world has slowed to a near stop, with both sides playing hardball.</p><h2><strong>Impact On The Financial Markets</strong></h2><p>There was an immediate reaction from the markets, with the S&amp;P 500 down by double digits in the first few days. Since then, most of the financial markets have been trending downward as uncertainty regarding the tariff wars continues.</p><p>\\\nOn April 16, 2025, tensions escalated when the US introduced new restrictions on chip exports to China. Previously, NVIDIA had been allowed to export a powered-down version of its AI chips, called H20. However, under the new restrictions, exporting H20 chips will require a federal license, which is expected to cost NVIDIA over $5 billion in the current fiscal year.</p><h2>The Impact On The Crypto Markets</h2><p>President Trump’s latest tariff war picks up from where it was in 2018 to 2019. When the recent tariffs were announced, Bitcoin immediately dipped to around $76K per coin. The reason for this is that during times of high uncertainty, investors tend to reduce their appetite for high-risk assets. Within a few days, over $200 billion was wiped off the global crypto market.</p><p>\\\nHowever, crypto markets have proven to be much more resilient over the years and have not stayed down for long. By April 17, 2025, the price of Bitcoin had bounced back to just under $85K. Other major altcoins like Ethereum have also experienced a recovery, which lines up with the changing views on crypto, with some investors increasingly viewing it as a hedge against sudden changes in government policy.</p><p>Apart from volatility, investors in the crypto market are also worried about stagflation, which is a combination of slow growth and increased inflation. The new tariffs could drive up prices, reversing gains by the Fed to cool down inflation. If the current tariff regime persists, US real GDP per capita could dip by almost 1%, according to Fitch Ratings.</p><p>\\\nOn April 4, 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the tariffs announced by Trump were bigger than the Fed had expected. As such, the impact on growth and inflation would need to be monitored closely. Investors have begun pricing in interest rate cuts in 2025, a reversal of previous tightening expectations. However, the Fed faces a tough balancing act. If it cuts rates too fast, it could fan inflation, and waiting too long could deepen a downturn.</p><p>One notable aspect of the current trade wars is that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets fades after periods of stress. However, the short-term impact is high uncertainty. With the price of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market being determined by trade policy, analysts believe this could help purge the market of speculative pricing accumulated during the 2024 bull run.</p><p>\\\nAnalysts also believe that the ongoing turmoil could rekindle interest in DeFi, as traders look for alternatives to fiat systems at risk of disruption by geopolitical tensions.</p><p>The crypto market is highly influenced by fear and greed, and currently, the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index is sitting at 30, which signals there is heightened fear amongst investors. This index, which is rated from 0 to 100, with 100 being extremely hopeful, and 0 being extreme fear.</p><p>\\\nHowever, it is worth noting that towards the end of March, it briefly fell below 20, signalling extreme concern on tariffs. Its current level of 30 indicates that investors are claiming down. Despite the relative calm, interest in meme coins and altcoins has gone down significantly. As such, it means that in 2025, there might not be an altcoin season. Historically, Ethereum triggers the altcoin season. However, it is down 53% so far this year, and down 16% in the past month.</p><p>\\\nInstead, the best opportunity this year is likely in Bitcoin, whose reputation as digital gold continues to gain traction. While there is still debate about Bitcoin’s long-term store of value, it appears to be holding up quite well amid the tariff wars compared to other top cryptos.</p><h2>Bitcoin As a Strategic Asset</h2><p>If the trade wars do not cool down, it is possible that governments around the world could begin to eye Bitcoin as a strategic asset. While bigger countries like China can hold off the impact for months or possibly years, tiny countries may not have that luxury, forcing them to take unusual steps to achieve their economic goals.</p><p>\\\nA good example is the proposed Bitcoin Reserve by Trump. The current proposal is that Bitcoin should be considered a strategic asset like oil or gold, and the government should have a stockpile of it. There have been proposals to pay down the US national debt of over $37 trillion using Bitcoin.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that stablecoins, which are pegged to the USD, could be used to attain certain monetary goals. Most stablecoins are backed by cash and short-term Treasury bills.</p><h2>Future Threats and Opportunities Amid Tariffs</h2><p>Amid tariff wars, there are numerous threats and opportunities that exist for the crypto world. One of these is the potential strengthening of the US dollar. However, a subsequent end to such wars could reverse this gain. As such, investors might seek refuge in Bitcoin, which could act as a hedge against dollar value instability.</p><p>\\\nOngoing global de-dollarization is another important factor. Many countries, such as China, are not actively looking for alternatives to the USD. Additionally, the BRICS nations are working on an alternative currency to the dollar. In such a fragmented world, where the dollar is not the standard for international trade, Bitcoin could thrive. The use of BTC is often most prevalent where it is the only neutral option available. The current trade wars could trigger its fast adoption in this role.</p><p>\\\nAnother noteworthy consideration is potential panic. While the markets have remained calm, with hopes that deals could be reached soon, there is still the potential for panic if tariff wars persist. The tariff wars could erase $5 trillion in market valuation, flatten yields, and make traditional safe havens like gold less attractive. Such conditions could potentially lead investors to consider high-risk, high-reward alternatives like Bitcoin.</p><p>\\\nThe tariff wars could also expose some inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities in global institutions. They could trigger debt defaults and erode trust in the global fiat system. In such a scenario, Bitcoin would fit in perfectly since it is the exact purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>The ongoing tariff wars and border geopolitical tensions present both threats and opportunities for the crypto market. These tariff wars have brought the role of Bitcoin in the global financial sector into sharp focus, including forecasts on how leading crypto projects could perform in the long term.</p><p>\\\nCurrently, the crypto market is bearish, driven by fear, with the price of Bitcoin still below its all-time high of over $100K. However, despite the ongoing uncertainty, one point that is clear is that while Bitcoin is not a guaranteed investment, it is one of the best assets to have if the ongoing tariff wars turn into an all-out global trade war. \\n </p>","contentLength":7636,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Intel Posts Newest Code For Cache Aware Scheduling On Linux","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RFC-Cache-Aware-Sched","date":1745231460,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":676,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Intel engineers have recently been working on the notion of cache-aware scheduling / load balancing for benefiting the likes of Intel and AMD processors sporting multiple caches.

I bring more than a decade of technical expertise and an inherent love for building products at scale. From building full-stack solutions using the latest technologies — React, Node.js, GraphQL, Microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes — to delivering critical products for Fortune 500 companies, I thrive on problem-solving and teamwork. I’ve successfully led cross-functional projects &amp; teams to propel startups and established firms across telecommunications, subscription commerce, and enterprise planning product lines. This unique mix of hands-on engineering,  leadership, and mentorship makes me well-suited to provide thought leadership on the future of technology and its impact on business.</p><h2>How Did You Start Writing?</h2><p>I actually discovered writing almost by accident while working as a frontend engineer on Twilio’s Phone Numbers team. We were rolling out a new feature, and I kept looking for answers at multiple places. One afternoon, I grabbed a blank doc and sketched a step‑by‑step guide for myself. Suddenly, I could see how writing forced me to clarify complex flows and helped me look for answers to the same questions again and again.</p><p>\\\nSoon, I drafted more documents on the systems and technologies I was working. I realized writing wasn’t just a supplement to calls—it was my way to scale impact, reach dozens at once, and leave a lasting reference.</p><h2>How Has Technology Impacted The Way You Write?</h2><p>Technology has completely changed my writing by enhancing every phase. I typically use any of the new AI tools to create a high‑level outline of the topic, and then I add my own thoughts and insights. Once I have an initial draft, I use Grammarly to fix any issues related to grammar, clarity, and flow. This mix of AI-assisted brainstorming and debugging ensures authenticity while making sure the content is error-free and engaging, allowing me to focus on creativity.</p><h2>Share About Your Journey Highlights?</h2><p>In the last year, I have written more than 10 moderated articles across multiple forums, and each one of those articles has taught me something new. My proudest moment came the day when one of my articles was featured on the HackerNoon homepage, that was a big W. After a few days, I was named as a Top 10 Cloud Writer.</p><p>\\\nMy low was when one of the initial days when I had a lot of thoughts about a particular topic, but it took me a really long time to put them coherently into an article. Those early times of battling writer’s block were quite disappointing. They taught me that I gotta slow down, organize my thoughts, be consistent, and keep writing!</p><h2>What’s Your Creative Process?</h2><p>Most of my writing inspiration comes from the problems I faced at work or a new technology I have been learning on the side. First, I write down the main points in my Notion workspace, then I do some research to fill any gaps. Once I feel I have a good understanding, I write a rough draft, add some code snippets, my personal opinion, and learnings. I typically go through a draft 3-4 times to refine it before I submit it for review.</p><h2>Your Favorite Memory/Article(s) to This Day?</h2><h2>How Did You Hear About HackerNoon? Share With Us About Your Experience With HackerNoon.</h2><p>I first discovered Hackernoon about 6-7 years ago, and I have been an avid reader since then.

Instead, the industry has declined steadily as investors become wary of macroeconomic constraints and scams.</p><p>\\\nTrump’s resounding election victory had emboldened crypto enthusiasts. There were also some  since the President re-entered the White House which indicated that their ambitions for the industry could finally be realized.</p><p>\\\nThe repeal of an accounting rule by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and an executive order by Trump focusing on directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations along with the possible formation of a strategic government reserve of cryptocurrencies within 180 days would be music to the ears of investors.</p><p>\\\nUpon Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024, the total global cryptocurrency market capitalization rallied from $2.26 trillion on election night to a peak of $3.72 trillion by December 17. However, just two months on, we’ve seen the total crypto market cap recede  in an unexpected contraction.</p><p>\\\nDespite the President’s crypto-friendly outlook, it’s possible that the early days of Trump 2.0 are playing a role in undermining the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem at a time when Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow (S2F) model has forecasted a post-halving bull run.</p><p>\\\n“There are concerns about how Trump's policies could affect cryptocurrency markets in the long term,” suggests Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “His administration's approach to taxation and regulation could introduce uncertainty that could scare off some investors.”</p><p>\\\n“In addition, any significant market corrections or increased volatility could lead to a reassessment of risk among cryptocurrency investors. Therefore, while the near-term outlook may remain positive, the sustainability of this bullish trend will depend on specific regulatory changes, Fed policy, and broader economic conditions.”</p><h2>Presidential Memecoins Undermine Trust</h2><p>One of the more unexpected trends of crypto in 2025 so far has revolved around the launch of memecoins backed by multiple Presidential figures. In Argentina, President Javier Milei has risked impeachment by backing the launch of the $LIBRA coin.</p><p>\\\nFollowing a  on social media platform X, the coin rallied in value before Milei decided to delete the post causing a collapse that saw many lose out on their investment.</p><p>\\\nBut it was the launch of $TRUMP that caused the biggest stir in the crypto memecoin space in 2025. The official Presidential token, which was soon followed by the launch of $MELANIA, the official token of the First Lady, drew accusations of a cash grab, due to the President’s team controlling at least .</p><p>\\\nAt the time of writing, $TRUMP has sunk 77% from its peak value, while $MELANIA is more than 90% below its all-time high.</p><p>\\\nThe Trump administration has denied any wrongdoing with the launch of official Presidential memecoins, and maintains that purchasing the token is merely a show of support to the President and First Lady, rather than an investment opportunity.</p><p>\\\nRecently, it was announced that anybody who bought official Trump products before February 15, 2025, would be able to claim three free $TRUMP tokens, opening the door to a prospective loyalty scheme associated with the coin.</p><p>\\\nHowever, it’s been the proliferation of memecoins that has risked undermining the wider crypto landscape’s momentum in recent weeks. The launch of $TRUMP prompted an  posing as the official memecoin, damaging trust in the ecosystem in the process.</p><p>\\\nFollowing the high-profile collapse of the $HAWK memecoin promoted by influencer Haliey Welch in December, crypto pump-and-dump schemes have been a key concern for investors, and there’s a danger that meme investing is damaging the liquidity of the market in its entirety.</p><p>\\\nWorryingly, the value of Bitcoin, the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency has slid more than 8% back below $100,000 in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. But there have been many different factors at play in driving the price of BTC lower.</p><h2>Macroeconomics Push Bitcoin Lower</h2><p>There have been many reasons behind Bitcoin’s poor performance during the early stages of Trump 2.0.</p><p>\\\nOne major factor has stemmed from Wall Street , the generative AI platform that overtook ChatGPT as the most downloaded app.</p><p>\\\nWith the Chinese firm illustrating that the AI boom isn’t isolated to Wall Street, markets became fearful of overvaluations domestically.</p><p>\\\nBecause the cryptocurrency market correlates with Wall Street, the market became more volatile as a result.</p><p>\\\nTrump’s tariffs have also contributed to more volatility throughout the cryptocurrency landscape, with many global risk assets impacted by the uncertainty brought by the impact on trade.</p><p>\\\nIt may be that the impact of these macroeconomic pressures is pushing crypto lower in the short term, but could help Bitcoin to return to its cyclical rally in the months ahead.</p><h2>Could Skies be Set to Clear?</h2><p>Despite the impact of $TRUMP on the cryptocurrency landscape becoming the subject of much debate, the Trump administration continues to explore new projects within the ecosystem.</p><p>\\\nThe recent announcement by the Trump-backed venture World Liberty Financial that it would launch a strategic token reserve designed to boost the crypto market, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been a timely piece of good news to provide a boost to investors.</p><p>\\\nDubbed the ‘Macro Strategy’, the initiative could lead to a reserve that maintains a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) as a means of improving the quality of financial services offered throughout the fintech market.</p><p>\\\nAnother source of optimism stems from the announcement of the ‘DOGE Dividend’, which the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, suggested could come in the form of a $5,000 cheque sent to US taxpayers using the savings made by his department in 2026.</p><p>\\\nThis payout could provide a widespread cryptocurrency market boost akin to the rollout of government stimulus packages amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2>Is This The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?</h2><p>The cryptocurrency landscape has historically relied on Bitcoin’s halving cycle to chart out the coin’s market rallies. As the only metric that produced a consistent trend in a market that’s filled with volatility, Bitcoin’s cycles have been an excellent investment tool.</p><p>\\\nHowever, the return of Donald Trump has seen an unprecedented level of attention fall on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. As a result, we’re seeing investor sentiment driven by many factors that fall outside of Bitcoin’s cycles.</p><p>\\\nIf Trump can continue to propel crypto further into the limelight then it’s likely to be bullish for the industry as a whole.

On April 15, 2025, <a href=\"https://solosatoshi.com\">Solo Satoshi</a> announced a pivotal milestone on <a href=\"https://x.com/SoloSatoshi\">X</a>: over 10,000 <a href=\"https://www.solosatoshi.com/bitaxe-the-ultimate-crypto-mining-machine/\">Bitaxe miners</a> sold, contributing more than 10 petahashes of hashpower to bitcoin home miners globally. Fueled by a chaotic, unplanned flash sale, this achievement signals a global shift, with Bitaxe miners humming in homes from North America to Africa, Europe to Asia. These compact devices are bringing mining back to the people, enabling anyone to strengthen Bitcoin’s decentralized network. This article dives into the Bitaxe’s technology, its role in home mining, and the milestone that proves small bitcoin mining machines can reshape the future of Bitcoin.</p><h2>A Global Milestone for Home Mining</h2><p>The sale of 10,000 Bitaxe miners marks a turning point for Bitcoin. Each miner represents an individual or small group bolstering the network’s security, collectively delivering over 10 petahashes (10 quadrillion hashes per second) of computational power. Operating in diverse settings, from rural cottages to urban apartments, these devices show that solo mining is not a relic; it’s a reality. The global spread of Bitaxe miners highlights a rising demand for accessible, efficient tools that empower everyday people to contribute to Bitcoin’s decentralized ecosystem.</p><p>\\\n   This milestone was driven by a spontaneous flash sale for the <a href=\"https://www.solosatoshi.com/product/bitaxe-gamma-solominer/\">Bitaxe Gamma</a>, priced at $125.99. Launched on a whim by Solo Satoshi, the sale sparked a frenzy, pushing the company past the 10,000-device mark. Unlike the massive Antminer rigs dominating corporate mining farms, the Bitaxe offers a compact, energy-efficient option for home use. A weekly giveaway of a Bitaxe 601 Gamma with free global shipping followed, further expanding the device’s reach. As Bitcoin’s halving events reduce the block reward every four years, efficiency becomes critical, making the Bitaxe’s role increasingly vital.</p><h2>Solo Satoshi: Pioneering Access to Bitaxe</h2><p>Founded in May 2024, Solo Satoshi is led by Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, a trio committed to making Bitcoin mining accessible. Matt’s strategic insight, Hunter’s technical knowledge, and Kelsie’s operational expertise drive the company’s efforts through their website, <a href=\"http://solosatoshi.com\">solosatoshi.com</a>. As sellers of Bitaxe miners, they focus on connecting people with open-source bitcoin mining hardware, providing resources and a community hub for enthusiasts.</p><h3>The Open-Source Movement in Bitcoin Mining</h3><p>Bitaxe is a product of the open-source movement, a core principle of Bitcoin’s philosophy. Created by @skot9000 (on X), the Bitaxe’s designs, schematics, and firmware are freely available on Github, inviting anyone with technical curiosity to build, modify, or enhance the device. This openness fosters a global community of developers and miners who share knowledge and drive innovation. Unlike proprietary systems that restrict users to rigid ecosystems, the Bitaxe encourages customization, making it a versatile tool for learning and contributing to Bitcoin’s security. </p><p>\\\n   The open-source approach is gaining momentum as home miners seek alternatives to expensive, controlled hardware. By providing access to the Bitaxe’s blueprints, the community ensures mining remains inclusive, enabling hobbyists and small-scale miners to participate affordably. This movement aligns with Bitcoin’s values of transparency and decentralization, positioning the Bitaxe as a beacon of resistance against centralized control in mining.</p><h3>Centralization Fears in Bitcoin Mining</h3><p>Large-scale mining operations have sparked concerns about Bitcoin’s decentralization. Insights from sources like Ocean (a decentralized mining pool) and other industry voices highlight key risks. First, the concentration of hashpower in a few major pools could enable collusion, allowing dominant players to manipulate transaction confirmations or prioritize specific transactions. Second, geographic centralization in regions with cheap electricity creates vulnerabilities to regulatory actions or natural disasters. Third, proprietary hardware limits innovation and locks miners into costly systems. Finally, the environmental impact of industrial mining, with its energy-intensive farms, has raised sustainability concerns.</p><p>\\\n   The Bitaxe miner counters these issues by enabling individuals to contribute hashpower from their homes, reducing dependence on centralized pools. Its open-source design challenges proprietary hardware monopolies, and its low energy consumption supports greener mining practices. For those pursuing lottery mining (where a solo miner competes for the rare chance to mine a block and claim the full block reward), the Bitaxe provides a practical way to participate independently.</p><p>The Bitaxe, instigated by @skot9000, is a compact, open-source Bitcoin mining device designed to make mining accessible to everyone. When it first appeared, few outside the open-source community recognized its potential, but Solo Satoshi, among the earliest adopters, championed it through sales on their website and the X platform, helping it reach thousands. The Bitaxe is engineered for home use, delivering 1.2 terahashes per second (TH/s) while consuming just 18 watts, a fraction of the power required by industrial miners. This efficiency makes it ideal for small-scale home mining setups, offering a stark contrast to the resource-heavy equipment of large operations.</p><p>\\\n   The <a href=\"https://www.solosatoshi.com/product/bitaxe-gamma-solominer/\">Bitaxe Gamma</a>, exemplifies its user-friendly design. With plug-and-play functionality, beginners can connect the device to a power supply, change a few settings, and start mining bitcoin in minutes, no complex setup required. Advanced users benefit from its open-source nature, which allows customization, such as modifying firmware and the plethora of adjustments that can be made through AxeOS (The Bitaxe’s operating system). The Bitaxe’s compact size, 40mm fan, and very low heat output means it can run quietly on a desk or shelf, blending seamlessly into home environments. Unlike traditional miners that demand specialized cooling or infrastructure, the Bitaxe is built for simplicity and accessibility</p><p>\\\n   Versatility is a hallmark of the Bitaxe. It supports solo mining, where miners compete independently for block rewards, as well as pool mining for more consistent payouts. Its affordability and efficiency appeal to hobbyists, educators, and those mining to support Bitcoin’s network rather than solely for profit. The device also doubles as an educational tool, helping users explore blockchain technology and mining mechanics hands-on. By distributing the Bitaxe, Solo Satoshi has made this technology widely available, enabling a new wave of miners to engage with Bitcoin’s ecosystem.</p><h2>The Rise of Home Mining: Plebs Take Charge</h2><p>Home mining is experiencing a revival, powered by devices like the Bitaxe. In Bitcoin’s early days, anyone with a computer could mine, but rising difficulty shifted the landscape to industrial farms. The Bitaxe reverses this trend, allowing ordinary people to run miners from their homes, contributing to Bitcoin’s security. This movement is about more than earning rewards; it’s about upholding Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos.</p><p>\\\n   The Bitaxe’s simplicity makes home mining feasible. With low power costs (comparable to a lightbulb) and minimal setup, it fits into any household. Miners need only a stable Wi-Fi and a small space, and the device’s quiet operation ensures it runs without disruption. For many, the excitement of solo mining, chasing the elusive block reward through lottery mining, is a driving force, but even pool miners strengthen the network’s resilience.</p><p>\\\n  Stories of home miners illustrate the Bitaxe’s impact. A student in Tokyo mines from their dorm to learn about blockchain, while a retiree in Texas runs a Bitaxe to support Bitcoin’s mission. These plebs, as the Bitcoin community affectionately calls grassroots enthusiasts, are proving that small-scale mining matters. The 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, represent a growing network of home miners fortifying Bitcoin’s decentralization.</p><h2>A Bright Future for Bitaxe and Bitcoin</h2><p>The milestone of 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, powered by 10 petahashes and an anarchic flash sale, marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin mining. Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, through Solo Satoshi, have played a key role by distributing these devices globally, making them accessible to thousands. Their early support for Skot’s creation and their chaotic energy has helped the Bitaxe become a cornerstone of home mining.</p><p>\\\n   As Bitcoin grapples with centralization and scalability challenges, the Bitaxe offers a path forward. It empowers individuals to contribute to the network, learn about bitcoin mining, and uphold Bitcoin’s decentralized principles. With every Bitaxe running in a home, the network grows stronger, more resilient, and truer to its roots.

Examples and Counterexamples","url":"https://hackernoon.com/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent-examples-and-counterexamples?source=rss","date":1745201007,"author":"HeraHaven AI","guid":285,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The term \"AI agent\" seems to be everywhere lately. From tech news headlines to business strategy discussions, it's rapidly becoming one of the most prominent terms in the artificial intelligence lexicon. Like many popular tech terms, however, its meaning can sometimes get diluted, leading to its use as a catch-all buzzword. So, what really constitutes an AI agent?</p><p>\\\nAt its core, the defining characteristic of an AI agent is its ability to autonomously perform actions to achieve a goal. This means they don't just process information or respond to direct commands; they interact with their environment (digital or physical), make decisions, and execute tasks with a degree of independence. Humans set the objectives, but the agent figures out the steps and takes them.</p><p>The key differentiator for an AI agent is its capacity for autonomous action. While many AI tools can process information, generate text, or answer questions, an AI agent goes further. It perceives its environment, whether that's sensor data, user input, or information from the web or databases, and then uses that information to plan and execute actions. These actions could be digital, like sending emails, updating databases, executing trades, or triggering other processes, or physical, in the case of robots or self-driving cars.</p><p>\\\nCrucially, this action-oriented nature requires capabilities like reasoning, planning, and often learning or adaptation. The agent needs to understand its goal, figure out the necessary steps, potentially use various tools (like APIs or web searches), and carry out those steps, sometimes correcting its course along the way. This distinguishes agents from simpler AI tools or assistants that primarily respond to user prompts or require human decision-making at each step. Merely gathering and presenting information, however sophisticatedly, doesn't meet this definition. The agent must do something based on that information, moving towards its objective without constant human intervention.</p><p>When defined by autonomous action, several types of AI systems qualify as agents:</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomous Driving Systems</strong>: Self-driving cars are a prime example. They perceive their environment (roads, obstacles, traffic signals) using sensors, plan navigation paths, and take actions (steering, braking, accelerating) to reach a destination safely.</li><li>: These agents analyze market data in real-time, make decisions based on predefined (or learned) strategies, and autonomously execute buy or sell orders.</li><li><strong>Smart Home Controllers (with Action)</strong>: While some smart home devices merely report status, a true agent might autonomously adjust thermostat settings based on occupancy patterns it learns, or proactively lock doors at a certain time, taking action rather than just providing information or waiting for a command.</li><li><strong>Autonomous Workflow Tools</strong>: Platforms like Auto-GPT or specialized agents built with frameworks like CrewAI aim to take a high-level goal (e.g., \"research competitors and summarize findings\") and break it down into subtasks, autonomously using tools like web browsers or APIs to gather information, analyze it, and compile a report. Replit Agent is another example that aims to build applications based on natural language prompts.</li><li><strong>Customer Service Agents (with Action Capability)</strong>: While many chatbots only answer questions, more advanced agents can perform actions like processing refunds, changing passwords, or updating customer information in a CRM system, directly resolving issues instead of just providing instructions.</li><li><strong>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enhanced with AI</strong>: Some advanced RPA systems incorporate AI agents that don't just follow pre-programmed rules but can adapt to changes, make decisions within a process, and handle more complex, multi-step workflows autonomously.</li></ul><h2>Counterexamples: What Isn't an AI Agent</h2><p>Understanding what isn't an AI agent (under this action-oriented definition) helps clarify the concept:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Chatbots (like early ChatGPT)</strong>: While highly capable at processing language and generating human-like text, chatbots that primarily respond to user prompts without autonomously initiating tasks or interacting with external systems beyond information retrieval generally don't qualify as agents. They react, but don't typically act proactively towards a persistent goal without continuous prompting.</li><li> Systems that suggest products, movies, or news articles analyze data and make predictions, but they don't autonomously act on those recommendations (e.g., purchasing the item for you). The action relies on the user.</li><li><strong>Basic Data Analysis Tools</strong>: AI tools that analyze datasets and present insights, dashboards, or reports are providing information, not autonomously taking action based on those insights.</li><li><strong>AI-powered Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly)</strong>: These tools enhance a user's actions (writing) by providing suggestions or corrections, but they don't autonomously write documents or send emails on the user's behalf based on a goal.</li><li><strong>Image Recognition Services</strong>: AI that identifies objects in images performs a sophisticated perception task but doesn't inherently take autonomous action based on that recognition.</li></ul><p>While \"AI agent\" is indeed a term enjoying significant buzz, understanding its core meaning – an AI tool capable of autonomous action towards a goal – is crucial. This ability to perceive, reason, plan, and act independently distinguishes true agents from many other valuable but less autonomous AI tools. As these technologies continue to evolve, recognizing this distinction will be key to understanding their capabilities and potential impact on various tasks and industries.</p>","contentLength":5628,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Quickly Extract Month Values in Excel with the MONTH Function","url":"https://hackernoon.com/quickly-extract-month-values-in-excel-with-the-month-function?source=rss","date":1745200726,"author":"Excel24x7","guid":284,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The  function in Excel is used to extract the  from a given input date.
