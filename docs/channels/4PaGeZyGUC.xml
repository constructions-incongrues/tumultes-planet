In August 1941, the Allies launched Operation Dervish. This was the first of the Arctic Convoys, ships which sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland and North America, and brought essential supplies to the Soviet Union.

After the successful launch of Operation Barbarossa, the USSR was in desperate need of raw materials, fuel, military equipment and food. Realising the importance of keeping the Germans fighting on two fronts, Churchill offered a helping hand to Stalin.

Though eager to cooperate, the task of shipping supplies to the Soviet ports of Murmansk and Archangel was not an easy task. Sailing up through the treacherous Northern Atlantic, the convoys were faced with some of the harshest seafaring conditions, including temperatures that reached -30 degrees Celsius, gale force 10 winds, towering seas, intense fog and drift ice. The sailors on deck also had to be wary of the continuous threat of icebergs.

If this wasn‚Äôt enough of a challenge to the 78 convoys that made the journey to the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945, the merchant vessels also faced the serious possibility of U-Boat attacks or German bombing raids.

As the convoys skirted occupied Norway en route to Murmansk and Archangel, the close proximity of German air and naval bases meant that attacks on the convoys were commonplace, and casualties were inevitable. Over 3,000 men lost their lives on the Arctic Convoys with 87 merchant ships and 18 Royal Navy ships lost.

In this documentary, Dan Snow delves deep into the history of the Arctic Convoys and reveals the ultimate sacrifice of the crews onboard the ships that made the perilous journey.

The name he chose as Pope refers to St Francis of Assisi. He set out to reform the Vatican; he advocated climate protection and inter-religious dialogue.

In March 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina was elected 266th Pope, the first South American to become spiritual leader of the Catholic Church. He set out to reform the Vatican and the papal office, advocated climate protection and inter-religious dialogue.The name he chose toi be known by refers to St Francis of Assisi. Following "the little poor man‚Äôs‚Äù example, Bergoglio wanted a "poor church for the poor".

In memory of Pope Francis, Deutsche Welle is rebroadcasting the feature "Pope Francis ‚Äî A Shepherd in the Storm.‚Äù On the occasion of the Pope's 85th birthday in December 2021 our report was an opportunity to take stock of his pontificate. What was this Pope able to change and reform; where were his limits? How did he lead the Catholic faith community through a time marked by crises and scandals? We gave people who knew Pope Francis personally, priests who advised him or were critical of his initiatives, and of course the Catholic laity, with their hopes and belief in a just pope, the opportunity to share their image of Pope Francis.

But why? Is it due to nutrition? The good weather? Or genetics? Scientists around the world are attempting to solve the mystery.

91-year-old Antonangelo leads a busy life. Every morning, he goes to milk his flock of sheep and later, turns that milk into cheese. "Work is my life, if I stop, I'll die,‚Äù says Antonangelo. Like many Sardinians in the mountain regions, he and his wife eat almost exclusively local produce. Their recipes for a long life are exercise and healthy food.

Giuseppino is already 100 years old and still manages most of the steep paths in his home village of Villagrande on foot. Is the strenuous hillside location the secret of his longevity? Giuseppino's family takes care of him, but he still lives alone in his flat and is bursting with energy. For him, a positive attitude and a sense of humor are key to a long life.

Despite a good deal of research, the secrets of the Blue Zones still haven‚Äôt been fully explained. But one study from the region does concludes that genetics play an important role in the first half of life. For 91-year-old Carolina, it‚Äôs clear that an intact family is a prerequisite for a long life. She has no intention of going into an old people's home. For her, the most important thing is for a mother to grow old with her children. And traditional food preparation is still one of her favorite pastimes.

Leonard Clark and his family, spanning three generations in the village, have meticulously documented over 1,000 sunken ships. They seek to help the people of the Magdalen Islands, all descendants of shipwrecked sailors, to uncover their ancestry.  Leonard, an amateur archaeologist and shipwreck descendent, has dedicated his life to unraveling the history of the Magdalen Islands, tracing the origins of numerous shipwrecks, and deciphering clues to sunken treasures claimed by the sea. Along this unique journey, Leonard Clark shares historical insights and tales of sunken treasures with Mario Cyr, a local hero and globally acclaimed underwater cameraman.

Bedouins on dozens of pickup trucks follow them, cheering them on and trying to keep pace. Welcome to Zalaga!

The annual camel race in Zalaga, in the south of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, is one of the oldest and most famous in the world. For decades, this Bedouin tradition has been passed down from generation to generation. And every year, children are selected to ride the camels. Most of them come from impoverished backgrounds and hope the job will earn them some money. The film accompanies one of these boys as he prepares for the big race. Life in the desert is tough. The boys must rely on themselves: Far away from their families, they have little prospect of a decent education.

Over 55 million people worldwide live with dementia, a number expected to rise to 139 million by 2050, with the greatest increases in low and middle-income countries where 60% of people affected by dementia already live.

Studies show that being part of a community, being physically active and eating healthily are some of the things that can help maintain the quality of life for dementia patients.

The film accompanies these men of faith and combat, from their recruitment in Switzerland to their military training in the heart of the Vatican.

Made up of 150 men, this elite corps lives in barracks in the heart of Vatican City. All must be Swiss nationals and devout Catholics. All have sworn to fight to the death to protect their faith and the Holy Father.

They are heirs to a 500-year-old tradition in which the Pope‚Äôs protection and security were assured by mercenaries from Switzerland.

Trained to wield both halberds and semi-automatic assault rifles, the Swiss Guards form a unique army. But who are they really? What motivates these young boys to join this military and religious corps? An insight into a world usually closed to the cameras.

But given that Bear Grylls is an outdoor expert who survived a massive fall while in the British Special Forces, climbed Mt. Everest before he was 25, and traversed the North Atlantic in an inflatable raft, he gets the benefit of the doubt.  But evidence suggests Grylls may not be as rugged a survivalist as he seems. In fact, some of his wilderness tips have even been called into question by other experts. So what gives?

Here‚Äôs why.

Every spring, millions of people are left coughing, sneezing, and itching their way out of winter. It‚Äôs a sign that nature is blooming back to life, dumping a ton of pollen into the air ‚Äî and, subsequently, our respiratory tracts. Seasonal allergies are undeniably miserable, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that people are looking for miracle cures. One popular idea is to try and microdose pollen with honey.

The theory goes like this: Pollen causes seasonal allergies. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowering plants to produce honey. So‚Ä¶a small amount of pollen is found in honey, therefore if you eat local honey you can introduce small amounts of pollen to your immune system and help your body gradually build an immunity to it. Boom. Seasonal allergies cured. The only problem? It doesn‚Äôt actually work, but honey does have a ton of other benefits. Watch the video above to learn more.

ABSTRACT
Responsible technology is having its time in the sun currently. Concerns about misinformation, bias, data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and accessibility issues, to name just a few of the concerns, seem to appear everywhere in the media. Who is the latest organization to be breached? Which airport is recovering from an "incident" - that wonderfully vague word?

Delivering technology in a responsible manner includes considering all the stakeholders to the solution, not just the obvious ones. The various flavors of architects operating across a solution (perhaps just a small number of people wearing different hats) must attempt to bring the perspectives of other stakeholders into the discussion surrounding features, targets, security requirements, and more. Making this work can be a challenge for teams.

In this talk, I will first discuss some principles of responsible technology and describe the various ways that making tech responsible generates value for organizations. I will then discuss how various aspects of responsible tech intersect with our good friends the -ilities. Finally, I will describe some techniques that can be used to support teams on their way to building responsible technology. [...]

DESCRIPTION
In a spirited discussion on collaborative modeling and decision-making, the the authors of ‚ÄúCollaborative Software Design: How to Facilitate Domain Modeling Decisions‚Äù‚ÄîEvelyn vVan Kelle, Gien Verschatse, and Kenny Baas-Schwegler‚Äîexplored the power of inclusive decision-making, shared understanding, and how to navigate social dynamics like bias, ranking and conflict in teams together with Xin Yao.

They highlighted the importance of facilitating not just through structured methods, but by empowering everyone in the team to contribute and lead decisions. Drawing from their experiences, they shared insights into the process of making better decisions through collaboration, the impact of "Deep Democracy", and the value of being able to step back and allow teams to thrive independently. Their conversation also touched on resources like Thinking, Fast and Slow, Jam Cultures, and Sitting in the Fire‚Äîtools to help teams make smarter decisions and grow together.

At one-one-thousandth of a second after the Big Bang, the great annihilation event should have wiped out all matter, leaving a universe of only radiation. Why still don't know why any matter survived. Well, a new finding from the LHC brings us one step closer to understanding why there's something rather than nothing.

Borne out of desperation and bound to fail, the revolt becomes one of the key events of World War Two.

In 1940, hundreds of thousands of people, most of them Jewish, were crammed into a few square kilometers in the Polish capital Warsaw under the most terrible living conditions. The deportations to extermination camps began in 1942. A Jewish resistance organization was formed. SS troops marched into the ghetto in April 1943 and were met by hundreds of fighters who tried to push them back by force of arms.

The courage of these people has largely been forgotten. Many of those heroic Jewish fighters were women. The film hears the account of two of those women, Cywia Lubetkin and Rachel Auerbach, who survived the Holocaust and whose stories have never been heard. Through the interlinking of their narratives, the film sheds light on neglected, unknown aspects of the Warsaw revolt. Featuring photographic and video footage that‚Äôs never been seen before, the documentary explores the connections between individual lives and the march of history.
