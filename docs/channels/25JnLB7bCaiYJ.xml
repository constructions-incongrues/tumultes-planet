The Guardian reports: A Soyuz capsule carrying the American and two Russian cosmonauts landed in Kazakhstan on Sunday, Pettit's birthday. "Today at 0420 Moscow time (0120 GMT), the Soyuz MS-26 landing craft with Alexei Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and Donald (Don) Pettit aboard landed near the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan," Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.
 
Spending 220 days in space, Pettit, Ovchinin and Vagner orbited the Earth 3,520 times and completed a journey of 93.3m miles over the course of their mission. It was the fourth spaceflight for Pettit, who has logged more than 18 months in orbit during his 29-year career. Nasa said in a statement that Pettit was "doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth." A recording of the touchdown can be viewed here.
 
Earlier this year, Pettit managed to take one of the best photos ever captured from space. "When I first saw it, I was dazzled by its beauty," wrote Ars Technica's Eric Berger. "But when I looked further into the image, there were just so many amazing details to be found."
 
"In this image, one can see the core of the Milky Way galaxy, zodiacal light (sunlight diffused by interplanetary dust), streaks of SpaceX Starlink satellites, individual stars, an edge-on view of the atmosphere that appears in burnt umber due to hydroxide emissions, a near-sunrise just over the horizon, and nighttime cities appearing as streaks."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Quest To Build Islands With Ocean Currents In the Maldives</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2056255/the-quest-to-build-islands-with-ocean-currents-in-the-maldives?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review: Arete Glacier Initiative has raised $5 million to improve forecasts of sea-level rise and explore the possibility of refreezing glaciers in place.
Off one atoll, just south of the Maldives' capital, Male, researchers are testing one way to capture sand in strategic locations -- to grow islands, rebuild beaches, and protect coastal communities from sea-level rise. Swim 10 minutes out into the En'boodhoofinolhu Lagoon and you'll find the Ramp Ring, an unusual structure made up of six tough-skinned geotextile bladders. These submerged bags, part of a recent effort called the Growing Islands project, form a pair of parentheses separated by 90meters (around 300 feet). The bags, each about two meters tall, were deployed in December 2024, and by February, underwater images showed that sand had climbed about a meter and a half up the surface of each one, demonstrating how passive structures can quickly replenish beaches and, in time, build a solid foundation for new land. "There's just a ton of sand in there. It's really looking good," says Skylar Tibbits, an architect and founder of the MIT Self-Assembly Lab, which is developing the project in partnership with the Male-based climate tech company Invena.
 
The Self-Assembly Lab designs material technologies that can be programmed to transform or "self-assemble" in the air or underwater, exploiting natural forces like gravity, wind, waves, and sunlight. Its creations include sheets of wood fiber that form into three-dimensional structures when splashed with water, which the researchers hope could be used for tool-free flat-pack furniture.Growing Islands is their largest-scale undertaking yet. Since 2017, the project has deployed 10 experiments in the Maldives, testing different materials, locations, and strategies, including inflatable structures and mesh nets. The Ramp Ring is many times larger than previous deployments and aims to overcome their biggest limitation.
 
In the Maldives, the direction of the currents changes with the seasons. Past experiments have been able to capture only one seasonal flow, meaning they lie dormant for months of the year. By contrast, the Ramp Ring is "omnidirectional," capturing sand year-round. "It's basically a big ring, a big loop, and no matter which monsoon season and which wave direction, it accumulates sand in the same area," Tibbits says. The approach points to a more sustainable way to protect the archipelago, whose growing population is supported by an economy that caters to 2 million annual tourists drawn by its white beaches and teeming coral reefs. Most of the country's 187 inhabited islands have already had some form of human intervention to reclaim land or defend against erosion, such as concrete blocks, jetties, and breakwaters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Hallucinations Lead To a New Cyber Threat: Slopsquatting</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/04/22/0118200/ai-hallucinations-lead-to-a-new-cyber-threat-slopsquatting?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 01:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers have uncovered a new supply chain attack called Slopsquatting, where threat actors exploit hallucinated, non-existent package names generated by AI coding tools like GPT-4 and CodeLlama. These believable yet fake packages, representing almost 20% of the samples tested, can be registered by attackers to distribute malicious code. CSO Online reports: Slopsquatting, as researchers are calling it, is a term first coined by Seth Larson, a security developer-in-residence at Python Software Foundation (PSF), for its resemblance to the typosquatting technique. Instead of relying on a user's mistake, as in typosquats, threat actors rely on an AI model's mistake. A significant number of packages, amounting to 19.7% (205,000 packages), recommended in test samples were found to be fakes. Open-source models -- like DeepSeek and WizardCoder -- hallucinated more frequently, at 21.7% on average, compared to the commercial ones (5.2%) like GPT 4. Researchers found CodeLlama ( hallucinating over a third of the outputs) to be the worst offender, and GPT-4 Turbo ( just 3.59% hallucinations) to be the best performer.
 
These package hallucinations are particularly dangerous as they were found to be persistent, repetitive, and believable. When researchers reran 500 prompts that had previously produced hallucinated packages, 43% of hallucinations reappeared every time in 10 successive re-runs, with 58% of them appearing in more than one run. The study concluded that this persistence indicates "that the majority of hallucinations are not just random noise, but repeatable artifacts of how the models respond to certain prompts." This increases their value to attackers, it added. Additionally, these hallucinated package names were observed to be "semantically convincing." Thirty-eight percent of them had moderate string similarity to real packages, suggesting a similar naming structure. "Only 13% of hallucinations were simple off-by-one typos," Socket added. The research can found be in a paper on arXiv.org (PDF).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Airbnb Now Shows the Full Price of Your Stay By Default</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/22/0110251/airbnb-now-shows-the-full-price-of-your-stay-by-default?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 01:12:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Airbnb is rolling out a global update that displays the total cost of a stay upfront in search results. The only fee that won't be included are taxes. The Verge reports: The company first started showing the full price of its listings in some locations in 2019 after facing scrutiny from the European Union over how it displays its fees. It later launched a toggle in the US and hundreds of other countries that shows the total cost of a stay across Airbnb's search results, individual listings pages, and other areas of the platform.
 
Airbnb says nearly 17 million people have used the toggle since its launch in 2022, and now, you won't have to worry about turning the option on when making a search. Instead, you'll now see a banner at the very top of your search results that says, "Prices include all fees."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Implements Stricter Performance Management System With Two-Year Rehire Ban</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/22/018236/microsoft-implements-stricter-performance-management-system-with-two-year-rehire-ban?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 01:08:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is intensifying performance scrutiny through new policies that target underperforming employees, according to an internal email from Chief People Officer Amy Coleman. The company has introduced a formalized Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) system that gives struggling employees two options: accept improvement targets or exit the company with a Global Voluntary Separation Agreement. 

The policy establishes a two-year rehire blackout period for employees who leave with low performance ratings (zero to 60% in Microsoft's 0-200 scale) or during a PIP process. These employees are also barred from internal transfers while still at the company. 

Coming months after Microsoft terminated 2,000 underperformers without severance, the company is also developing AI-supported tools to help managers "prepare for constructive or challenging conversations" through interactive practice environments. "Our focus remains on enabling high performance to achieve our priorities spanning security, quality, and leading AI," Coleman wrote, emphasizing that these changes aim to create "a globally consistent and transparent experience" while fostering "accountability and growth."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rivian elects Cohere’s CEO to its board in latest signal the EV maker is bullish on AI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/rivian-elects-coheres-ceo-to-its-board-in-latest-signal-the-ev-maker-is-bullish-on-ai/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:27:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Aidan Gomez, the co-founder and CEO of generative AI startup Cohere, has joined the board of EV maker Rivian, according to a regulatory filing.

The battery manufacturer also introduced a sodium-ion battery called Naxtra, offering up to 500km range for EVs and potential to diversify global energy resources. The Financial Times reports: The claims by the Chinese battery groups would put them ahead of major western rivals. At present, Tesla vehicles can be charged up to 200 miles (321km) in added range in 15 minutes, while Germany's Mercedes-Benz recently launched its all-electric CLA compact sedan, which can be charged for up to 325km within 10 minutes using a fast-charging station. [...] The second generation of the Shenxing battery, which boasts a range of 800km on one charge, can achieve a peak charging speed of 2.5km per second, the company said at a media event ahead of this week's Shanghai auto show.
 
"We look forward to collaborating with more industry leaders to push the limits of supercharging through true innovation," said CATL's chief technology officer Gao Huan, adding that he wanted the new batteries to become "the standard for electric vehicles." Analysts at Bernstein said the latest progress meant that charging speeds had more than doubled in the past year and "increased tenfold over the past 3-4 years." Huan said the new Shenxing battery would be installed in more than 67 EV models this year. He later told reporters that energy density would not be sacrificed as a trade-off for fast charging.
 
During its tech day, CATL also unveiled its new sodium-ion battery, which it said would go into mass production in December. The battery brand called Naxtra is able to give a range of about 200km for a hybrid vehicle and 500km for an electric vehicle, according to Huan. [...] At the event, Huan claimed the new sodium-ion battery would enable the industry's shift from "single resource dependence" to "energy freedom" and reshape the global energy landscape. He added that he was in discussions with several companies about using sodium-ion batteries in their vehicles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WD Launches HDD Recycling Process That Reclaims Rare Earth Elements, Cuts Out China</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2039200/wd-launches-hdd-recycling-process-that-reclaims-rare-earth-elements-cuts-out-china?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from Tom's Hardware: While most people enjoy PCs that are powered by SSDs, mechanical hard drives are still king in the datacenter. When these drives reach the end of their useful lives, they are usually shredded, and the key materials they're made of -- including several rare earth elements (REE) -- end up as e-waste. At the same time, countries are mining these same materials and emitting a lot of greenhouse gases in the process. And China, a major source of REE, recently announced export restrictions on seven of them, potentially limiting the U.S. tech industry's access to materials such as dysprosium, which is necessary for magnetic storage, motors, and generators.
 
[On Thursday], Western Digital announced that it has created a large-scale hard disk drive recycling program in concert with Microsoft and recycling-industry partners CMR (Critical Materials Recycling) and PedalPoint Recycling. The new process reclaims Rare Earth Oxides (REO) containing dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium from hard drives, along with aluminum, steel, gold, palladium, and copper. The REO reclamation takes place completely within the U.S. and those materials go back into the U.S. market.
 
Dubbed the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, WD's initiative has already saved 47,000 pounds worth of hard drives, SSDs, and caddies from landfills or less-effective recycling programs. WD was able to achieve a more than 90% reclaim rate for REE and an 80% rate for all of the shredded material. The drives came from Microsoft's U.S. data centers where they were first shredded and then sent to PedalPoint for sorting and processing. Magnets and steel were then sent to CMR, which uses its acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) technology to extract the rare earth elements.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon Has Paused Some Data Center Lease Commitments, Wells Fargo Says</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2031221/amazon-has-paused-some-data-center-lease-commitments-wells-fargo-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies' spending plans.

I’ve given each one a nickname for convenience:Amazon Analyze Expense API, or “”Azure AI Document Intelligence - Invoice Prebuilt Model, or “”Google Document AI - Invoice Parser, or “”GPT-4o API - text input with 3rd party OCR, or “”GPT-4o API - image input, or “”Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, or “”Deepseek v3 - text input, or “”The models were tested on a dataset of 20 invoices of various layouts and years of issue (from 2006 to 2020).| Invoice Year | Number of Invoices |
|----|----|
| 2006 — 2010 | 6 |
| 2011 — 2015 | 4 |
| 2016 — 2020 | 10 |Analyzing each invoice, I’ve determined a list of 16 key fields that are common among all invoices and contain the most important data:\
Invoice Id, Invoice Date, Net Amount, Tax Amount, Total Amount, Due Date, Purchase Order, Payment Terms, Customer Address, Customer Name, Vendor Address, Vendor Name, Item: Description, Item: Quantity, Item: Unit Price, Item: Amount.\
Fields extracted by the models were mapped to a common naming convention to ensure consistency. LLM models (GPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini) were specifically asked to return the results using these common field names.For each invoice, I’ve evaluated how well the models extracted key items’ fields:\
Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Total PriceI’ve used a weighted efficiency metric (Eff, %) to assess the accuracy of extraction. This metric combines:\
Strict Essential Fields: Exact matches, like invoice ID, dates, etc.\
Non-Strict Essential Fields: Partial matches allowed if similarity (RLD, %) exceeds a threshold.\
Invoice Items: Evaluated as correct only if all item attributes are extracted accurately.==Overall Efficiency (Eff, %): Eff, % = (COUNTIF(strict ess. fields, positive) + COUNTIF(non-strict ess. fields, positive if RLD > RLD threshold) + COUNTIF(items, positive)) / ((COUNT(all fields) + COUNT(all items)) * 100==\
==Item-Level Efficiency (Eff-I, %): Eff-I, % = Positive IF (ALL(Quantity, Unit Price, Amount - positive) AND RLD(Description) > RLD threshold) * 100==Invoice Recognition Results\
: Google’s results are omitted from this as Google failed to extract items properly.Azure isn’t the best with item descriptions.One of the invoices in the dataset contains employee names as items. In this invoice, Azure failed to detect the full item names, recognizing only the first names, whereas other models successfully identified the complete names in all 12 items.\
This issue significantly impacted Azure’s efficiency on this invoice, which was notably lower (33.3%) compared to the other models.\
💡 Azure’s inability to parse multi-word descriptions in structured fields highlights a critical limitation compared to competitors.Low resolution of invoices practically does not affect the quality of detection.Low resolution (as perceived by the human eye) of invoices generally did not degrade detection quality. The low resolution mainly results in minor recognition mistakes, for example, in one of the invoices, Deepseek mistook a comma for a dot, leading to an incorrect numerical value.\
💡 Modern OCR and AI models are robust to resolution issues, though rare formatting errors may occur.Google fails at detecting items.Google combines all item fields into a single string, which makes it impossible to compare the results to other models. Google recognition results:\
All other services have 100% correct detection with breakdown by attributes.\
💡 Google’s AI is not capable of extracting structured data without fine-tuning.Multi-line item descriptions did not affect the quality of detection.💡 Except for Google AI’s case above, multi-line item descriptions did not negatively impact detection quality across all models.Gemini has the best “attention to detail.”LLMs like GPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek can be asked to extract more data than pre-built invoice recognition models. Among all LLMs, Gemini has the best accuracy when it comes to extracting additional data from invoice items. GPT often extracted correct fields but incorrect field values, and DeepSeek performed the worst out of the 3 models with the poorest field value extraction accuracy.\
💡 Gemini has the highest items extraction accuracy compared to other LLMs: it extracts all fields, not just the standard ones, and has the highest accuracy in preserving text and numerical values.I’ve calculated the cost of processing 1000 invoices by each model, as well as the average cost of processing one invoice:| Service | Cost | Cost per page (average) |
|----|----|----|
|  | $10 / 1000 pages (1) | $0.01 |
|  | $10 / 1000 pages | $0.01 |

Co-founder Michael Truell apologized for the issue, clarified that no such policy exists, and attributed the mishap to AI hallucination and a session management bug. The Register reports: Users of the Cursor editor, designed to generate and fix source code in response to user prompts, have sometimes been booted from the software when trying to use the app in multiple sessions on different machines. Some folks who inquired about the inability to maintain multiple logins for the subscription service across different machines received a reply from the company's support email indicating this was expected behavior. But the person on the other end of that email wasn't a person at all, but an AI support bot. And it evidently made that policy up.
 
In an effort to placate annoyed users this week, Michael Truell co-founder of Cursor creator Anysphere, published a note to Reddit to apologize for the snafu. "Hey! We have no such policy," he wrote. "You're of course free to use Cursor on multiple machines. Unfortunately, this is an incorrect response from a front-line AI support bot. We did roll out a change to improve the security of sessions, and we're investigating to see if it caused any problems with session invalidation." Truell added that Cursor provides an interface for viewing active sessions in its settings and apologized for the confusion.
 
In a post to the Hacker News discussion of the SNAFU, Truell again apologized and acknowledged that something had gone wrong. "We've already begun investigating, and some very early results: Any AI responses used for email support are now clearly labeled as such. We use AI-assisted responses as the first filter for email support." He said the developer who raised this issue had been refunded. The session logout issue, now fixed, appears to have been the result of a race condition that arises on slow connections and spawns unwanted sessions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Columbia student suspended over interview cheating tool raises $5.3M to ‘cheat on everything’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/columbia-student-suspended-over-interview-cheating-tool-raises-5-3m-to-cheat-on-everything/</link><author>Charles Rollet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:03:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Sunday, 21-year-old Chungin “Roy” Lee announced he’s raised $5.3 million in seed funding from Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures for his startup, Cluely, that offers an AI tool to “cheat on everything.” The startup was born after Lee posted in a viral X thread that he was suspended by Columbia University after he and […]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Patch Queued To Report Outdated Intel CPU Microcode As A Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Old-Microcode-Vulnerable</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:55:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year a patch was raised for the Linux kernel that would report outdated CPU microcode versions as a security vulnerability.

The Whisky project has "been more or less in this state for a few months, I posted the notice mostly to clarify and formally announce it," Marovitz said, having received "a lot of questions" about the project status. [...] "Whisky, in my opinion, has not been a positive on the Wine community as a whole," Marovitz wrote on the Whisky site.
 
He advised that Whisky users buy a CrossOver license, and noted that while CodeWeavers and Valve's work on Proton have had a big impact on the Wine project, "the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is practically zero." Fixes for Wine running Mac games "have to come from people who are not only incredibly knowledgeable on C, Wine, Windows, but also macOS," Marovitz wrote, and "the pool of developers with those skills is very limited." While Marovitz told Ars that he's had "some contact with CodeWeavers" in making Whisky, "they were always curious and never told me what I should or should not do." It became clear to him, though, "from what [CodeWeavers] could tell me as well as observing the attitude of the wider community that Whisky could seriously threaten CrossOver's viability." "Whisky may have been a CrossOver competitor, but that's not how we feel today," wrote CodeWeavers CEO James B. Ramey in a statement. "Our response is simply one of empathy, understanding, and acknowledgement for Isaac's situation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD ROCm 6.4 Adds SPIR-V Linking Support To HIP</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-ROCm-6.4-SPIR-V-Linker</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:58:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With the recently released AMD ROCm 6.4 release for this open-source GPU compute stack for Radeon and Instinct hardware there are yet more indications around AMD's growing software ecosystem expansion.

These initiatives, including the Digital Bangladesh program (ICT Policy 2009), Smart Bangladesh (ICT Master Plan 2041), and National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2024, focus on harnessing the global digital revolution to kickstart technological innovation and digital transformation in Bangladesh.\
However, the core of Bangladesh’s efforts to shape its digital future relies primarily on Bangladesh’s ability to truly harness its renewable energy sector. Despite its ambitious plans, power problems continue to plague Bangladesh, especially in the country’s growth-stage , where demand for energy far outpaces supply. In fact, Bangladesh experienced power outages for over 30% of all of 2022, highlighting the desperate need for Bangladesh to grow its energy supply.As Bangladesh moves toward a more digitally-driven economy, addressing its energy challenges becomes critical, not only for ensuring infrastructure sovereignty, but also for safeguarding its digital sovereignty.Renewable energy investmentBangladesh has one of the highest rates of power demand growth globally, resulting in a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, with  of its power generation coming from natural gas, while coal usage continues to increase as a source of electricity. Additionally, Bangladesh’s usage of coal will most likely increase as coal prices continue to fall due to reduced demand, increased coal supply, and shifts among developed nations to renewable energy, among a variety of other factors. As a result, Bangladesh needs to grow its renewable energy industry to plan for less dependency on harmful energy sources like natural gas and coal.\
Bangladesh’s efforts to grow its renewable energy sector have resulted in a significant need for foreign direct investment in its energy sector. China has played a  in Bangladesh-specific investments in renewable energy, with a focus on solar energy.  saw the announcement of a 100MW solar plant to be built by a joint venture between China's CREC International Renewable Energy Company and Bangladesh's state-owned B-R Powergen Limited (BRPL). Around the same time, a venture led by the Chinese firm Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company (BCRECL) resulted in the commissioning of the 68MW Sirajganj Solar Park. Additionally, China’s Huadian Corporation signed an agreement in mid-2024 to develop a solar facility with projected power production of 160MW.\
 also saw the beginning of operations for the 60MW Cox’s Bazar wind plant, noted as “the first centralized wind power project in Bangladesh invested and constructed by Chinese enterprises.” The BCRECL has also taken efforts to establish a 50MW wind power plant in Payra.\
Chinese investment in Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector continues to build, with notable Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi announcing its interest in Bangladesh-specific investments in March 2025. This visit built on a previous visit in late 2024 featuring LONGi and Tongwei Co., Ltd., another Chinese-based solar manufacturer, with both these trade delegations highlighting the increasing interest for Chinese firms and investors in controlling Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector.Investments in physical infrastructureChina’s involvement in Bangladesh extends beyond renewable energy, with China being a major player in financing and constructing critical infrastructure in Bangladesh, including ports, bridges, and power plants. As of mid-2024, China accounted for 27 power projects in Bangladesh, with the coal-fired Payra power plant, generating an impressive 1,320 MW of power, being built as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\
China has played a large role in developing and constructing crucial infrastructure in Bangladesh, ranging from ports to special economic zones (SEZs). Bangladesh’s Mongla port, its second largest port, received a loan of $400 million for modernization efforts on . Bangladesh’s largest port, Chittagong port, alongside the Payra port, both of significant strategic importance in the Indian Ocean, were both constructed by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), building on China’s strategy of establishing a crucial presence at strategic maritime centers throughout the globe. Additionally, the planned Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone,  as the “first industrial zone in Bangladesh invested, developed, and operated by a Chinese company,” has gained immense investment traction and acceleration in recent months, particularly given a bilateral meeting between leaders Muhammad Yunis and Xi Jinping in Beijing on March 28, 2025.\
China has also been a major source of financing, construction, and technical assistance in terms of bridge infrastructure in Bangladesh. The Padma bridge, a 6.15km bridge built at a cost of nearly $4 billion, was constructed by Chinese SOE China Major Bridge Engineering Company. As of , China was building over 20 bridges in Bangladesh, with over 650 companies investing into the country during the same period, with Chinese loans totalling just over $2.33 billion this time.Need for digital infrastructure sovereigntyAssuming Bangladesh can resolve its domestic power generation issues with clean energy controlled by Bangladesh interests, it must also take its digital infrastructure sovereignty into consideration as Bangladesh develops its digital economy.\
In the same vein, Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure is already seeing growing dependencies on Chinese firms and investment. In December 2024, Huawei announced efforts to bolster Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure development, notably co-launching an innovation lab with the Bangladesh government and establishing a China-Bangladesh fintech exchange program. Mid-2024 also saw Bangladesh’s former Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu lauding China’s technology innovation in telecommunications, e-commerce, green energy, and agriculture, and much more.\
These efforts build on Huawei’s , alongside other Chinese technology giants like ZTE, in growing Bangladesh's digital industry, with key  including 5G, enterprise cloud solutions, and much more. The Chinese government has also played a large role in advancing Bangladesh's technology development, completing a joint project in late 2022 to connect 2,600 government offices in a move to solidify national connectivity.In conclusion, Bangladesh's pursuit of a digital economy hinges on its ability to address critical challenges in energy infrastructure, with a focus on developing its renewable energy sources. With power shortages continuing to hinder growth, investing in clean sustainable energy is paramount for the nation’s digital transformation.\
While Chinese investments in energy, infrastructure, and digital technology have accelerated progress, they also highlight the need for Bangladesh to carefully manage its long-term energy and digital sovereignty.\n If it is able to secure a sustainable energy future, Bangladesh can effectively harness its full potential to develop its digital economy while maintaining its digital infrastructure sovereignty, enabling it to emerge as a competitive player in the global digital economy.\

However, a macroeconomic environment that’s punctuated by aggressive trading sanctions may be an opportunity for AI models to show their value.\
According to Franklin Templeton, equity securities are  with their prices prone to fluctuations and the loss of principle. In particular, small and mid-cap stocks can struggle amid greater risks and volatility compared to larger capitalization stocks.\
Likewise, fixed-income securities can be affected by uncertainty among interest rates, credit, inflation, reinvestment risks, and the possible loss of capital. Because tariffs are inflationary by nature, combative interest rate hikes by the Fed can prompt the value of fixed-income securities to fall.\
JP Morgan data states that US trade policy uncertainty has , far surpassing the volatility experienced at any other stage in the past 40 years.\
The investment bank suggests that policy documents, executive orders, and public statements by the Trump administration point to a significant change in America’s trading relationship on the world stage.\
For hedge funds, market uncertainty can be an opportunity in the pursuit of alpha. However, clouded outlooks call for a more robust approach to identifying opportunities and capitalizing on them faster than their competitors.\
With the news that Minotaur Global Opportunities Fund, consisting of a fully AI-powered portfolio, achieved a  in its first six months to January 2025, doubling the performance of its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index in the process, artificial intelligence could be a key solution to navigating a prospective trade war for hedge funds.How do Trade Wars Impact Markets?We can look to history to better understand the impact of the Trump administration’s use of tariffs on markets.\
During the tariff wars that were initiated during Trump’s first term, US equities markets saw greater levels of volatility as performance was dictated by news on trade talks and the future of the tariffs in place. This, , led to more investors embracing ‘safe haven’ assets on a global scale.\
In instances where tariff talks broke down or additional trade tariffs were applied, US stocks experienced sell-offs. On the other hand, when optimism surrounding trade deals improved, stocks generally rose.\
When the Phase I trade deal was announced in October 2019, stocks rallied. While tariffs contributed to a 4.38% contraction in the S&P 500 in 2018, the clearing outlook led to 31.49% gains in 2019. Similar patterns could be found in the China A Index over the same period.\
What does this mean for Wall Street during Trump’s second term? Given that the President is seeking to implement a protectionist approach to the US economy, we can expect the volatility experienced in 2018 and 2019 to be more pronounced should tariffs continue to be used as a bargaining chip on the world stage.\
For hedge funds seeking to outmaneuver markets to take advantage of the volatility of trade wars, it’s worth looking at how AI can help leverage more decisive, data-driven actions.Minotaur Capital, which is an investment firm based in Sydney, Australia, has sought to cut costs using artificial intelligence, with founder Armina Rosenberg suggesting that it’s around ‘half the price’ to operate in terms of cost versus a junior analyst salary.\
Crucially, its large language model (LLM) framework consumes  daily and can deliver 2,000-word reports on just about any global stock that it believes has the potential to double its value in three years or tenfold over the next decade.\
Given the chaotic nature of trade wars, this ability to consume breaking news at scale and use it to deliver comprehensive reports means that AI can help hedge funds navigate uncertainty far more efficiently than human analysts. This can be a particular advantage at a time when  differently to emerging news on a daily basis.\
While Minotaur is a use case where AI appears to be outperforming benchmarks in a fully autonomous environment, Liming Zhu, a professor at the University of New South Wales, believes that the best outcomes for the technology come from environments with bottom-up experimentation and deep human expertise. \
This calls for prime services for hedge funds that can tailor products to the individual needs of hedge funds that can turn to embedded AI to improve their actionable market insights.\
This means that firms can interpret forecasts as probabilistic, and make measured risks based on educated judgment calls from structured and unstructured data.Fundamentally, the incorporation of AI and its measured outcomes helps hedge funds to act with agility in the face of market uncertainty.\
Although trade wars can cloud the macroeconomic outlook for US equities and investment opportunities throughout the rest of the world, artificial intelligence tools can turn risky market conditions into an opportunity to make moves that other institutions have failed to identify, opening the door to alpha even as investor sentiment struggles for momentum.\
The artificial intelligence boom has been rapidly building momentum on Wall Street, and for its hedge fund adopters, a prospective global trade war could be an opportunity to test its capabilities.

This marks a significant cultural and operational shift.Non-Use of AI Requires JustificationEmployees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources (e.g., more staff or time). Stagnation is framed as failure, and employees are encouraged to upskill and experiment with AI continuously.AI in Product DevelopmentAI must be integrated into the early stages (prototype phase) of all GSD (get shit done) projects. This approach is intended to dramatically accelerate learning, iteration, and team collaboration.Performance AccountabilityShopify is adding AI usage to its performance and peer review criteria, making AI adoption part of how employees are evaluated and rewarded, including leadership and executive teams.I do not work at Shopify, and I am not affiliated with the company.I take AI tools as helpers and a mandatory tool both as a software developer and a writer, and I heavily rely on them.I am also an advocate of professional Vibe Coding.In every conference, article, and paper I write, I encourage humans to embrace the AI tools and use them heavily (with caution).I have two quotes (not mine):You must always be in control.AI won't take your job, but a human using it will certainly do; you should become that person.(You can see this at 53:40 of this conference)This week, I needed to make some local tests using Python.I write articles in 25+ different programming languages and don't have all of them installed locally.Sometimes I use virtual machines, codelabs and repl.it running on websites.This time, I needed to quickly install Python locally (an accidental task).It started with a simple idea: automate a few things. Save time. Be smart.So I did what many people are doing now.AI answered fast. Confident. Like it had done a thousand times before.Spoiler: I blindly trusted it. One command later, my operating system was toast.In my code smell articles, I use the 10 most popular AI programming tools.I just opened one of them (ChatGPT) and prompted it to give me some commands to install Python on my Ubuntu.Give me a command to install Python in UbuntuUntil last week, I used to write:hello, please give me a command to install Python in UbuntuBut now I am aware that those extra tokens consume lots of resources (water, for example), and I am not polite to machines anymore. 😢🤖The answer was short and clear:sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -yI didn't bother to read it.I've been using Linux for more than 20 years now.I just pasted the answer. Typed my password mechanically (I was using sudo to install pip), and went to make dinner.When I came back, the terminal showed a very long list of commands. That was strange. I just wanted to install Python (with pip, which is the package manager).The problem (as you might have discovered by now) was this innocent line:Which upgraded (and bricked) my personal computer.ChatGPT decided it was a very good decision to upgrade the operating system first.I agree that keeping an updated operating system is a good decision to have the latest protections, but this is something you need to plan, have a good backup, and not something you do casually.The system was bricked, and so was I.A careful look to the command (and a question to other IAs) will give a more accurate (and safer) answer:I had a very long experience with Ubuntu. I was perfectly capable of reading a forum or googling (who googles anything today, BTW?).I am also a preacher on not to trust AIs blindly, and I enforce it on  I write.This should not happen to someone like me.Our brain is a master of efficiency.Every decision we make consumes energy, so the oldest part of our brain, the so-called "reptilian brain", evolved to optimize for survival, not for deep thinking.It wants quick reactions, minimal effort, and zero sugar waste.That’s why it loves delegation.But what happens when the thing you’re delegating to is a machine?You do it every day: you follow GPS instructions without questioning them, rely on autocomplete to finish your thoughts, and let a recommendation engine tell you what to watch, buy, or read.On the surface, this looks like convenience.Underneath, it’s a biological shortcut.Your brain’s decision-making resources are limited. To avoid fatigue, it offloads choices wherever possible.This isn’t always bad. Routines and heuristics allow you to function in a complex world without becoming overwhelmed.But when this primitive reflex takes control, you stop asking “why?” — and that’s when things get risky.One of the most dangerous aspects of AI delegation is the illusion of competence. A machine that speaks eloquently, formats correctly, or generates working code appears smart. Sometimes smarter than you.But behind the polish may lie shallow reasoning, misinterpretation, or even hallucinated content.You don’t notice because your cognitive laziness kicks in.You assume correctness because it "sounds right." The deeper, analytical part of your brain — your prefrontal cortex — never gets involved.This is exactly how misinformation spreads. It’s also how bugs get deployed, contracts go wrong, and systems fail.The human cost of faulty AI decisions is already here: people getting denied healthcare coverage, flagged as fraudulent, or jailed based on algorithmic predictions. In these cases, the true danger isn’t just the AI — it’s the uncritical acceptance of its output.When you delegate a decision to a system you don’t understand and don’t check, you’ve surrendered agency. Worse: you’ve surrendered accountability."The algorithm said so" becomes a shield. But it shouldn’t be.Delegation isn’t inherently bad. But you have to make it conscious. That means:Verifying the output of any AI you use, especially for critical tasksUnderstanding the limits of the system you’re relying onTaking back responsibility for decisions, even when tools make them easierAm I outsourcing this because it’s efficient — or because I’m lazy?”That question alone can re-engage your rational brain.Your brain wants to survive.It doesn’t care if your software works, your model is fair, or your report is accurate.It just wants to offload effort.That worked fine in the jungle.But not in a world where decisions have digital consequences.Delegation without scrutiny is not efficiency. It’s abdication.And if you don’t remain in control of your decisions, someone—or something-else will.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Zuckerberg once suggested spinning out Instagram as a solution to its ‘cannibalization’ of Facebook</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/mark-zuckerberg-once-suggested-spinning-out-instagram-as-a-solution-to-its-cannibalization-of-facebook/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:56:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In an internal email surfaced as part of the Meta antitrust trial, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fretted about the potential that the company’s Instagram acquisition may cannibalize Facebook.

After a scaled-back plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve missed the mark with market sentiment, what’s next for the world’s most famous cryptocurrency?\
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. All indications pointed to a Bitcoin bull run throughout the first half of 2025. Buoyed by what should be a post-halving event rally alongside the high-profile approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in early 2024, many speculative crypto enthusiasts expected BTC to be performing far better today.\
The return of Trump to the White House represented the first time a pro-crypto President had taken office, and his campaign pledge of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was a catalyst for widespread optimism.\
Between election day on November 5, 2024, and Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, Bitcoin had rallied an astonishing 58.22%, underlining the confidence that investors had in the incoming President and his plans for crypto.\
Since the inauguration, BTC has fallen by more than 20%. With external factors like Wall Street volatility amid trade tariff uncertainty pushing crypto markets lower, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which monitors the market sentiment towards the cryptocurrency, : ‘extreme fear.’\
What’s changed? It appears that optimism was simply too high for the changes investors anticipated.One key source of investor confidence in BTC stemmed from the expectation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve being established by the President. On March 7, an  for a Bitcoin ‘Fort Knox’ was finally signed, but it wasn’t what crypto enthusiasts expected.\
The executive order focused on establishing a cryptocurrency reserve comprising of the 198,000 BTC the American government had seized through law enforcement confiscations, worth an estimated $17 billion.\
Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks also confirmed that  would be stockpiled, and that these reserves will also be comprised of assets forfeited in criminal proceedings.\
Because the reserve would be built using seized assets,  that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would “not cost taxpayers a dime.” However, with  from $90,000 to $84,600 before a slight rebound in the wake of the announcement, some investors wouldn’t share the same outlook.\
The issue with the executive order is that it falls short of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’s terms as initially laid out in the Bitcoin Act.\
“Under the so-called Bitcoin Act, the US must accumulate 1 million bitcoins within 20 years, with the goal of owning roughly 5% of the total supply,” explained Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “Coupled with huge demand from ETF funds, this could create a strong supply-demand imbalance, against this backdrop there are various expectations for the price of BTC”.\
Because the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, investors expected that the US topping up their reserve of BTC to 1 million would significantly increase the asset’s scarcity and drive its value higher.\
It now appears that this won’t be the case. It also appears evident that Trump’s unpredictability is creating disruptive swings in sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market as a whole.The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?2025 was supposed to be the year where the cryptocurrency bull market resumed regardless of who was in office. Bitcoin’s cyclical nature, which is powered by its halving events every four years, has historically driven the entire market higher as the coin’s scarcity ramps up overnight.\
Bitcoin halving events occur because a  halves the volume of BTC distributed to its miners every four years. This is a deflationary tool that slows the rate of production for the coin and instantly makes it more scarce.\
Every halving event since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 has culminated in a bull market and fresh all-time high that’s considerably stronger than previous post-halving highs. Although January 2025 saw BTC trading at a fresh high of $108,786, expectations among investors were for the coin to climb higher this year.\
Tellingly, Bitcoin’s fall from its most recent all-time high came in the wake of the launch of $MELANIA, an official meme token for incoming First Lady, Melania Trump. With  of the token reportedly belonging to just 10 people, investors became fearful of a cash grab.\
Having launched $TRUMP as a meme coin just three days earlier, the meme tokens contributed to a loss of investor confidence that still hasn’t recovered, judging by Bitcoin’s consistent losses in the wake of the event.\
Trump’s outspoken approach to the Presidency has created more volatility not only in the cryptocurrency markets but also on Wall Street. The announcements and delays to tariffs and unprecedented new policies have carried a significant impact on sentiment-driven markets, and considering that there are few investment options that are more influenced by sentiment than crypto, these disruptions to Bitcoin’s historical cycles may bring an end to the last predictable trend within the ecosystem.Bitcoin, and the wider cryptocurrency market have correlated strongly with Wall Street in recent months. This is perhaps a logical result of aligning both markets with the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, it also means that Trump and Wall Street’s influence on the crypto market is going to weigh heavily on Bitcoin.\
At this stage, it’s important to reiterate that Trump is the most crypto-positive President we’ve seen enter the White House yet, and there’s plenty of room for his pro-growth stance to pay off for Bitcoin.\
However, in a landscape where Bitcoin’s cycles have a weakening influence, 2025 may shape up to be a challenging year for a cryptocurrency market that had so much expectation pinned upon it moving into the new year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PHNX Materials found a way to decarbonize concrete using dirty coal waste</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/phnx-materials-found-a-way-to-decarbonize-concrete-using-dirty-coal-waste/</link><author>Tim De Chant</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:41:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PHNX Materials has devised a way to strip fly ash of sulfur and aluminum, impurities that concrete companies would rather avoid.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Faces Off With US Government in Attempt To Break Up Company in Search Monopoly Case</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/1736226/google-faces-off-with-us-government-in-attempt-to-break-up-company-in-search-monopoly-case?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:36:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is confronting an existential threat as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into an illegal monopoly. From a report: The drama began to unfold Monday in a Washington courtroom as three weeks of hearings kicked off to determine how the company should be penalized for operating a monopoly in search. In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. "This is a moment in time, we're at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations," said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. 

The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a "remedy hearing," are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google's attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government's heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn't boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology. "Google won its place in the market fair and square," Schmidtlein said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GCC Patch Revived For -mtune=generic Showing Nice Benefits On Intel &amp; AMD CPUs</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GCC-Inline-Memset-Memcpy-Gen</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:26:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A 2021 era patch for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) has been revived and discussed in recent days around simplifying the memcpy and memset inlining strategies when compiling code with the "-mtune=generic" option.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is radically reshaping the landscape of personal finance, and the private student loan market is among the most affected sectors. As lenders integrate advanced data analytics and machine learning into their operations, the traditional barriers in student lending—inefficiency, bias, and inflexible loan structures—are beginning to dissolve.\
AI promises to streamline internal processes, personalize financial solutions for individual borrowers, improve fraud detection, and make lending more accessible to historically underserved populations.\
AI is transforming every private student loan lifecycle phase—from underwriting to loan servicing. Students must explore the challenges, ethical concerns, and future outlook for them and lenders alike.AI-Enhanced Risk Assessment: Moving Beyond Credit ScoresIn traditional lending models, credit scores and financial history have long dictated access to capital. This has placed younger borrowers, particularly students with thin or no credit files, at a disadvantage. AI, however, offers a new approach. AI can create a fuller picture of a borrower's future repayment ability by analyzing alternative data points such as academic records, school rankings, degree completion rates, and projected income by field of study.\
Machine learning algorithms can predict risk for thin-file consumers by analyzing a broader range of data. These models more accurately assess an individual's likelihood of defaulting on a loan, aiding lenders in making informed decisions about extending credit. This evolution helps to identify capable borrowers who may otherwise be overlooked, thereby expanding access to fair financing.\
​Upstart's AI-driven underwriting model has significantly enhanced credit accessibility and affordability compared to traditional methods. According to Upstart's , their model approves 43 percent more applicants overall, with an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 33 percent lower.\
Notably, the model has a pronounced positive impact on minority applicants. Such results highlight the potential of AI to promote financial inclusion by extending more favorable credit terms to a broader and more diverse applicant pool.​\
These innovations suggest the potential for greater inclusion in the education lending space, especially for non-traditional borrowers.Streamlining Loan Servicing Through Intelligent AutomationOnce a loan is approved, it is crucial for lenders and borrowers to manage it efficiently. AI is increasingly used to streamline loan servicing by automating repetitive tasks, reducing human error, and lowering operational costs. This includes AI-powered chatbots that handle borrower inquiries 24/7, predictive tools that flag potential delinquencies, and dynamic repayment systems that offer tailored assistance.\
Lenders adopting AI and automation tools could reduce operational costs while increasing borrower satisfaction through faster, more accurate responses. These savings may be passed on to borrowers through lower interest rates or financial incentives.\
AI can detect early signs of financial hardship, offering borrowers preemptive support options such as temporary forbearance, modified repayment plans, or personalized financial counseling. These AI-powered interventions promote healthier repayment outcomes and reduce defaults—an increasingly important metric as student debt levels climb.Fighting Fraud with Real-Time AI MonitoringAs the digital footprint of financial transactions expands, so does the risk of fraud. In the private student loan market, fraudulent applications—such as falsified school enrollment or identity theft—can result in significant losses. AI's strength in identifying patterns and outliers allows it to detect suspicious activity faster and more accurately than traditional systems.\
For example, modern fraud detection tools leverage machine learning to scan vast amounts of application data for anomalies such as duplicate documents, inconsistencies in personal information, and IP address mismatches.\
By deploying these technologies, private student lenders can bolster trust and ensure that legitimate borrowers are protected in a secure financial ecosystem.Personalization: The AI Advantage in Loan Terms and RewardsAI improves backend efficiency and transforms the borrower experience through hyper-personalization. By analyzing individual data profiles, AI systems can adjust loan terms dynamically, offering customized repayment schedules, targeted interest rates, and even performance-based incentives.\
AI can dynamically adjust loan offers, repayment terms, and even incentives by modeling borrower-specific risk profiles and financial behaviors.\
Students seeking a more flexible and transparent  experience are increasingly turning to lenders like SoFi, where AI enables features like tailored interest rates, autopay discounts (typically 0.25 percent), and suitable grade rewards for maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or higher.\
Such personalization ensures that students are not bound to rigid, one-size-fits-all terms. Instead, they benefit from financial products that evolve with their academic and economic circumstances—offering access to education and support throughout the journey.Strategic Use of AI Across the Borrowing LifecycleToday’s advanced fintech companies can lead the way in AI integration across multiple financial products. Beyond student loans, these companies employ AI for robo-advising, credit decisions, and member engagement. Their data models help identify high-potential borrowers, manage risks dynamically, and offer proactive financial advice to users across multiple channels.\
Comprehensive platforms also use predictive analytics to tailor communications, recommending products or actions based on a borrower's past behavior. For instance, a borrower nearing graduation may receive automated refinancing suggestions, while someone demonstrating repayment stress could be offered hardship support before a default occurs.\
This proactive and data-driven approach is a model for the next generation of private lenders—where personalization, automation, and financial wellness converge into a seamless digital experience.Addressing Ethical Concerns: Bias, Transparency, and Data PrivacyArtificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the lending industry, offering enhanced efficiency and broader access to credit. However, its integration brings forth critical ethical and regulatory considerations that must be thoroughly addressed to ensure fairness and compliance.​Data Privacy Regulations: GDPR and FERPAUsing alternative data in AI-driven lending necessitates stringent adherence to data privacy laws. In the United States, the broadly encompassing  (the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act) covers the privacy of students' education records, ensuring that personally identifiable information is safeguarded and not disclosed without consent.\
Lenders must navigate these regulations carefully, ensuring that borrowers are fully informed about how their data is collected, used, and protected.​Addressing Algorithmic BiasA significant challenge in deploying AI systems is mitigating algorithmic bias. AI models can inadvertently perpetuate existing prejudices in logged historical data, potentially leading to unfair treatment of applicants based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\
Recognizing this concern, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has emphasized that lenders are accountable for the AI technologies they employ.Regulatory Guidance from the CFPBTo address these challenges, the CFPB has  requiring lenders to ensure their AI systems are transparent and comply with existing credit laws. In a circular released in 2023, the CFPB clarified that creditors must provide specific reasons for adverse actions, even when decisions are made using complex algorithms.\
The guidance states that creditors should be able to explain in detail their reasons for denial. The new guidance provides no special exemption for artificial intelligence. This directive mandates that lenders offer clear and understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing consumers to comprehend and, if necessary, challenge the outcomes.A Glimpse Ahead: The Future of AI in Educational LendingAI's influence on private student lending is expected to deepen. AI-powered financial advisors will help students understand the implications of various borrowing choices, while intelligent dashboards may predict repayment bottlenecks before they occur.\
Dynamic refinancing models are already emerging, with AI recalibrating interest rates based on evolving income trends and job stability. Blockchain-backed identity verification could streamline loan disbursement and reduce administrative burdens.\
These innovations point toward a more intelligent and student-centric lending environment—one that adapts in real time to borrower needs rather than imposing static expectations.Toward a Smarter, Fairer Lending SystemAI is not a panacea for the student debt crisis, but it is a powerful tool for making the lending system more transparent, equitable, and responsive. From more accurate risk assessments and proactive servicing to fraud protection and personalization, AI enables a future where private student loans are more efficient and human-centered.\
With thoughtful implementation, robust oversight, and continued innovation, integrating AI into private student loans offers a sustainable path forward—bridging gaps in access, reducing financial distress, and empowering the next generation of students to succeed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>U.S. Pushes $900M for Small Modular Reactors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states</link><author>Shannon Cuthrell</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTkxMDg3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTMzNDk3Mn0.mWKYeRo65JUpgJYaR3YE6CWa51SYCXpKnzTSlMfan30/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A revamped Biden-era DOE program may not be enough to make SMRs a reality]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:54:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record — the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

The arrival of the internet introduced the concept of cloud computing, transforming how businesses store, manage, and process data by enabling access to computing resources over the internet. Traditional cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud operate on a centralized model. These services rely on large data centers owned and managed by a single entity, with inherent barriers (challenges) like security vulnerabilities, censorship, and less control over data.Traditional Cloud BarriersCentralized cloud models, with their innovation, are vulnerable to single points of failure, where a data center outage can disrupt all users. They also raise significant concerns about data privacy and security, as users must trust the provider with sensitive information. Additionally, businesses often face vendor lock-in, making it costly and complex to switch providers due to compatibility issues and data migration challenges. With the emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized cloud emerges as a viable alternative for cloud computing and storage that sets businesses free from barriers.\
Decentralized cloud computing differs by distributing computational resources, data storage, and services across multiple decentralized nodes, often powered by blockchain technology. This approach creates a more secure, transparent, and user-centric infrastructure that addresses the drawbacks of traditional cloud (centralized models).Decentralized cloud leverages on peer-to-peer networks to enhance resilience, privacy, and cost effectiveness, to offer a promising edge for businesses seeking greater control over their data.Why Decentralized Cloud: The AdvantagesResearch shows that decentralized cloud computing offers several advantages over traditional cloud services, making it a better option for businesses and individuals. And here is the detailed breakdown of these benefits.\
Enhanced Security and Privacy: Decentralized clouds distribute data across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches. Each piece of data is encrypted and stored in different locations, making it harder for attackers to access the datasets. Moreover, users retain control over their data, as they can encrypt it before it leaves their device, ensuring privacy. For example, platforms like Aleph Cloud implement client-side encryption, mitigating risks associated with centralized storage vulnerabilities such as malware and man-in-the-middle attacks.\
Resilience and Reliability: With no single point of failure, decentralized clouds are more resilient to outages and cyber attacks. If one node goes down, the network continues to function using other nodes, which ensures uninterrupted service. This resilience is particularly valuable for businesses reliant on continuous operations.\
 Decentralized clouds are more affordable and efficient, especially for smaller businesses. By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, businesses can use underutilized computing resources from other participants, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure. For instance, smaller companies often find centralized cloud fees, like AWS's $23 monthly charge for data center storage, as burdensome, whereas decentralized cloud providers like Aleph Cloud offer a more democratic pricing model.\
Scalability and Flexibility: Decentralized clouds scale more easily by adding more nodes to the network, accommodating fluctuating demand without the constraints of centralized infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial for applications with variable workloads, such as AI and machine learning, in comparison with centralized models.\
 With a decentralized cloud, individual users can monetize their computing resources by becoming node operators, creating a more inclusive ecosystem. This democratization allows individuals to earn rewards for contributing resources and promoting a community-driven approach.\
These advantages position decentralized cloud computing as a compelling alternative, particularly for businesses seeking to mitigate the risks and barriers associated with centralized cloud. Several projects are already at the forefront of decentralized cloud, demonstrating its practical applications and benefits. Among them is Aleph Cloud, offering decentralized compute and storage solutions that address the limitations of centralized cloud barriers.Understanding Aleph Cloud: The Web3 SupercloudAleph Cloud is a decentralized cloud platform that provides on-demand serverless computation, database, and storage infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Aleph Cloud leverages a two-layered architecture, comprising Core Channel Nodes (CCNs) and Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs). CCNs ensure security, process transactions, store data, and enable cross-chain communication, while CRNs provide computational power and data storage to ensure efficient task distribution. Unlike others that focus on static storage, Aleph Cloud handles data that needs real-time updates, making it ideal for dynamic applications. Aleph Cloud supercloud currently supports 24 chains for builders to seamlessly leverage Aleph Cloud innovation.:::info
Aleph Cloud is like a decentralized AWS for Web3, which provides serverless computing, dynamic storage, and databases through a network of nodes rather than one company's servers.Aleph Cloud Key features: Real World UsageAleph Cloud powers dynamic NFT metadata for blockchain-based games, notably through a partnership with Ubisoft. Since 2021, Ubisoft has run a Core Channel Node on Aleph Cloud to manage NFT metadata for games like Champions Tactics and Captain Laserhawk. This ensures secure, tamper-proof data for in-game assets, letting players mint, trade, or sell items with unique traits. Aleph Cloud Verifiable Random Function (VRF) adds fairness by generating transparent randomness for gameplay, addressing centralized cloud risks of data manipulation or outages.\
Decentralized Identity (DID)Aleph Cloud works with Synaps and Anima protocol to offer secure, self-sovereign identity management. Users can control their personal data like KYC metadata, without relying on centralized databases, which reduces data breach risks. This is a major advancement for industries like finance and healthcare, where privacy is critical, and it frees businesses from the costs and vulnerabilities of centralized storage.\
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)Aleph Cloud supports DeFi apps by providing resilient storage and computing for order books, transaction data, and real-time processing computation. Aleph distributed indexing lets DeFi platforms on high-throughput chains like Solana query on-chain data efficiently, avoiding the single points of failure common in centralized clouds like AWS, for DeFi projects to stay true to decentralization while scaling operations.Aleph Cloud's scalable computing and dynamic storage are perfect for AI-driven projects with real-time updates. It supports startups and enterprises building AI agents or large-scale models, offering confidential virtual machines (VMs) with AMD SEV encryption for secure processing. For instance, Aleph Cloud integration with Libertai.io allows AI models to run on a decentralized network, ensuring privacy and resilience.\
Web Hosting and Content DeliveryAleph Cloud-powered TwentySix Cloud platform offers decentralized website hosting (static or dynamic) and content delivery networks (CDNs). By distributing content across nodes, it improves load times and reduces bottlenecks, unlike centralized CDNs that can falter under heavy traffic. Businesses can host apps or sites with less risk of downtime and lower costs.\
Aleph Cloud also supports decentralized social media platforms, where user data stays private; supply chain tracking, with secure, real-time data from sensors; and healthcare platforms, where encrypted medical records are shared securely. These use cases show its versatility, helping businesses avoid centralized clouds barriers.Aleph cloud provides confidential virtual machines (VMs) secured with AMD SEV encryption, for enhanced data privacy and security which is a critical concern for businesses dealing with sensitive information.:::tip
Businesses benefit from Aleph Cloud by reducing dependence on centralized providers, lowering costs, and gaining more control over their data.Conclusion: Future of Decentralized CloudDecentralized cloud computing represents a significant shift from traditional cloud services, for enhanced security, privacy, resilience, and cost effectiveness. Projects like Aleph Cloud are at the forefront of this innovation, providing businesses with alternatives that address the limitations of centralized infrastructure barriers and single points of failure. For example, Ubisoft's NFT platform avoids the risks of centralized storage, while DeFi apps scale without single points of failure. Aleph Cloud also allows Individuals to join as node operators, earning ALEPH tokens for sharing resources, for a community-driven ecosystem.\

As the landscape evolves, the potential of decentralized cloud computing is already setting businesses free from the constraints of traditional models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariff Wars &amp; Crypto Market: The Threats And Opportunities</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tariff-wars-and-crypto-market-the-threats-and-opportunities?source=rss</link><author>Ilia Ilinskii</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:38:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 2, 2025, President Trump declared a national emergency and introduced a slew of tariffs targeting almost every country in the world. Dubbed “Liberation Day,” Trump’s administration established a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with a massive tariff of up to 245% on some imports from China.\
In retaliation, China introduced its own measures that include curbs on the export of rare earth minerals and tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. Since the tariffs kicked off, trade between the biggest and second biggest economy in the world has slowed to a near stop, with both sides playing hardball.Impact On The Financial MarketsThere was an immediate reaction from the markets, with the S&P 500 down by double digits in the first few days. Since then, most of the financial markets have been trending downward as uncertainty regarding the tariff wars continues.\
On April 16, 2025, tensions escalated when the US introduced new restrictions on chip exports to China. Previously, NVIDIA had been allowed to export a powered-down version of its AI chips, called H20. However, under the new restrictions, exporting H20 chips will require a federal license, which is expected to cost NVIDIA over $5 billion in the current fiscal year.The Impact On The Crypto MarketsPresident Trump’s latest tariff war picks up from where it was in 2018 to 2019. When the recent tariffs were announced, Bitcoin immediately dipped to around $76K per coin. The reason for this is that during times of high uncertainty, investors tend to reduce their appetite for high-risk assets. Within a few days, over $200 billion was wiped off the global crypto market.\
However, crypto markets have proven to be much more resilient over the years and have not stayed down for long. By April 17, 2025, the price of Bitcoin had bounced back to just under $85K. Other major altcoins like Ethereum have also experienced a recovery, which lines up with the changing views on crypto, with some investors increasingly viewing it as a hedge against sudden changes in government policy.Apart from volatility, investors in the crypto market are also worried about stagflation, which is a combination of slow growth and increased inflation. The new tariffs could drive up prices, reversing gains by the Fed to cool down inflation. If the current tariff regime persists, US real GDP per capita could dip by almost 1%, according to Fitch Ratings.\
On April 4, 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the tariffs announced by Trump were bigger than the Fed had expected. As such, the impact on growth and inflation would need to be monitored closely. Investors have begun pricing in interest rate cuts in 2025, a reversal of previous tightening expectations. However, the Fed faces a tough balancing act. If it cuts rates too fast, it could fan inflation, and waiting too long could deepen a downturn.One notable aspect of the current trade wars is that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets fades after periods of stress. However, the short-term impact is high uncertainty. With the price of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market being determined by trade policy, analysts believe this could help purge the market of speculative pricing accumulated during the 2024 bull run.\
Analysts also believe that the ongoing turmoil could rekindle interest in DeFi, as traders look for alternatives to fiat systems at risk of disruption by geopolitical tensions.The crypto market is highly influenced by fear and greed, and currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is sitting at 30, which signals there is heightened fear amongst investors. This index, which is rated from 0 to 100, with 100 being extremely hopeful, and 0 being extreme fear.\
However, it is worth noting that towards the end of March, it briefly fell below 20, signalling extreme concern on tariffs. Its current level of 30 indicates that investors are claiming down. Despite the relative calm, interest in meme coins and altcoins has gone down significantly. As such, it means that in 2025, there might not be an altcoin season. Historically, Ethereum triggers the altcoin season. However, it is down 53% so far this year, and down 16% in the past month.\
Instead, the best opportunity this year is likely in Bitcoin, whose reputation as digital gold continues to gain traction. While there is still debate about Bitcoin’s long-term store of value, it appears to be holding up quite well amid the tariff wars compared to other top cryptos.Bitcoin As a Strategic AssetIf the trade wars do not cool down, it is possible that governments around the world could begin to eye Bitcoin as a strategic asset. While bigger countries like China can hold off the impact for months or possibly years, tiny countries may not have that luxury, forcing them to take unusual steps to achieve their economic goals.\
A good example is the proposed Bitcoin Reserve by Trump. The current proposal is that Bitcoin should be considered a strategic asset like oil or gold, and the government should have a stockpile of it. There have been proposals to pay down the US national debt of over $37 trillion using Bitcoin.\
Additionally, current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that stablecoins, which are pegged to the USD, could be used to attain certain monetary goals. Most stablecoins are backed by cash and short-term Treasury bills.Future Threats and Opportunities Amid TariffsAmid tariff wars, there are numerous threats and opportunities that exist for the crypto world. One of these is the potential strengthening of the US dollar. However, a subsequent end to such wars could reverse this gain. As such, investors might seek refuge in Bitcoin, which could act as a hedge against dollar value instability.\
Ongoing global de-dollarization is another important factor. Many countries, such as China, are not actively looking for alternatives to the USD. Additionally, the BRICS nations are working on an alternative currency to the dollar. In such a fragmented world, where the dollar is not the standard for international trade, Bitcoin could thrive. The use of BTC is often most prevalent where it is the only neutral option available. The current trade wars could trigger its fast adoption in this role.\
Another noteworthy consideration is potential panic. While the markets have remained calm, with hopes that deals could be reached soon, there is still the potential for panic if tariff wars persist. The tariff wars could erase $5 trillion in market valuation, flatten yields, and make traditional safe havens like gold less attractive. Such conditions could potentially lead investors to consider high-risk, high-reward alternatives like Bitcoin.\
The tariff wars could also expose some inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities in global institutions. They could trigger debt defaults and erode trust in the global fiat system. In such a scenario, Bitcoin would fit in perfectly since it is the exact purpose for which it was designed.The ongoing tariff wars and border geopolitical tensions present both threats and opportunities for the crypto market. These tariff wars have brought the role of Bitcoin in the global financial sector into sharp focus, including forecasts on how leading crypto projects could perform in the long term.\
Currently, the crypto market is bearish, driven by fear, with the price of Bitcoin still below its all-time high of over $100K. However, despite the ongoing uncertainty, one point that is clear is that while Bitcoin is not a guaranteed investment, it is one of the best assets to have if the ongoing tariff wars turn into an all-out global trade war. \n ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Posts Newest Code For Cache Aware Scheduling On Linux</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RFC-Cache-Aware-Sched</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:31:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Intel engineers have recently been working on the notion of cache-aware scheduling / load balancing for benefiting the likes of Intel and AMD processors sporting multiple caches.

I bring more than a decade of technical expertise and an inherent love for building products at scale. From building full-stack solutions using the latest technologies — React, Node.js, GraphQL, Microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes — to delivering critical products for Fortune 500 companies, I thrive on problem-solving and teamwork. I’ve successfully led cross-functional projects & teams to propel startups and established firms across telecommunications, subscription commerce, and enterprise planning product lines. This unique mix of hands-on engineering,  leadership, and mentorship makes me well-suited to provide thought leadership on the future of technology and its impact on business.How Did You Start Writing?I actually discovered writing almost by accident while working as a frontend engineer on Twilio’s Phone Numbers team. We were rolling out a new feature, and I kept looking for answers at multiple places. One afternoon, I grabbed a blank doc and sketched a step‑by‑step guide for myself. Suddenly, I could see how writing forced me to clarify complex flows and helped me look for answers to the same questions again and again.\
Soon, I drafted more documents on the systems and technologies I was working. I realized writing wasn’t just a supplement to calls—it was my way to scale impact, reach dozens at once, and leave a lasting reference.How Has Technology Impacted The Way You Write?Technology has completely changed my writing by enhancing every phase. I typically use any of the new AI tools to create a high‑level outline of the topic, and then I add my own thoughts and insights. Once I have an initial draft, I use Grammarly to fix any issues related to grammar, clarity, and flow. This mix of AI-assisted brainstorming and debugging ensures authenticity while making sure the content is error-free and engaging, allowing me to focus on creativity.Share About Your Journey Highlights?In the last year, I have written more than 10 moderated articles across multiple forums, and each one of those articles has taught me something new. My proudest moment came the day when one of my articles was featured on the HackerNoon homepage, that was a big W. After a few days, I was named as a Top 10 Cloud Writer.\
My low was when one of the initial days when I had a lot of thoughts about a particular topic, but it took me a really long time to put them coherently into an article. Those early times of battling writer’s block were quite disappointing. They taught me that I gotta slow down, organize my thoughts, be consistent, and keep writing!What’s Your Creative Process?Most of my writing inspiration comes from the problems I faced at work or a new technology I have been learning on the side. First, I write down the main points in my Notion workspace, then I do some research to fill any gaps. Once I feel I have a good understanding, I write a rough draft, add some code snippets, my personal opinion, and learnings. I typically go through a draft 3-4 times to refine it before I submit it for review.Your Favorite Memory/Article(s) to This Day?How Did You Hear About HackerNoon? Share With Us About Your Experience With HackerNoon.I first discovered Hackernoon about 6-7 years ago, and I have been an avid reader since then.

Instead, the industry has declined steadily as investors become wary of macroeconomic constraints and scams.\
Trump’s resounding election victory had emboldened crypto enthusiasts. There were also some  since the President re-entered the White House which indicated that their ambitions for the industry could finally be realized.\
The repeal of an accounting rule by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and an executive order by Trump focusing on directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations along with the possible formation of a strategic government reserve of cryptocurrencies within 180 days would be music to the ears of investors.\
Upon Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024, the total global cryptocurrency market capitalization rallied from $2.26 trillion on election night to a peak of $3.72 trillion by December 17. However, just two months on, we’ve seen the total crypto market cap recede  in an unexpected contraction.\
Despite the President’s crypto-friendly outlook, it’s possible that the early days of Trump 2.0 are playing a role in undermining the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem at a time when Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow (S2F) model has forecasted a post-halving bull run.\
“There are concerns about how Trump's policies could affect cryptocurrency markets in the long term,” suggests Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “His administration's approach to taxation and regulation could introduce uncertainty that could scare off some investors.”\
“In addition, any significant market corrections or increased volatility could lead to a reassessment of risk among cryptocurrency investors. Therefore, while the near-term outlook may remain positive, the sustainability of this bullish trend will depend on specific regulatory changes, Fed policy, and broader economic conditions.”Presidential Memecoins Undermine TrustOne of the more unexpected trends of crypto in 2025 so far has revolved around the launch of memecoins backed by multiple Presidential figures. In Argentina, President Javier Milei has risked impeachment by backing the launch of the $LIBRA coin.\
Following a  on social media platform X, the coin rallied in value before Milei decided to delete the post causing a collapse that saw many lose out on their investment.\
But it was the launch of $TRUMP that caused the biggest stir in the crypto memecoin space in 2025. The official Presidential token, which was soon followed by the launch of $MELANIA, the official token of the First Lady, drew accusations of a cash grab, due to the President’s team controlling at least .\
At the time of writing, $TRUMP has sunk 77% from its peak value, while $MELANIA is more than 90% below its all-time high.\
The Trump administration has denied any wrongdoing with the launch of official Presidential memecoins, and maintains that purchasing the token is merely a show of support to the President and First Lady, rather than an investment opportunity.\
Recently, it was announced that anybody who bought official Trump products before February 15, 2025, would be able to claim three free $TRUMP tokens, opening the door to a prospective loyalty scheme associated with the coin.\
However, it’s been the proliferation of memecoins that has risked undermining the wider crypto landscape’s momentum in recent weeks. The launch of $TRUMP prompted an  posing as the official memecoin, damaging trust in the ecosystem in the process.\
Following the high-profile collapse of the $HAWK memecoin promoted by influencer Haliey Welch in December, crypto pump-and-dump schemes have been a key concern for investors, and there’s a danger that meme investing is damaging the liquidity of the market in its entirety.\
Worryingly, the value of Bitcoin, the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency has slid more than 8% back below $100,000 in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. But there have been many different factors at play in driving the price of BTC lower.Macroeconomics Push Bitcoin LowerThere have been many reasons behind Bitcoin’s poor performance during the early stages of Trump 2.0.\
One major factor has stemmed from Wall Street , the generative AI platform that overtook ChatGPT as the most downloaded app.\
With the Chinese firm illustrating that the AI boom isn’t isolated to Wall Street, markets became fearful of overvaluations domestically.\
Because the cryptocurrency market correlates with Wall Street, the market became more volatile as a result.\
Trump’s tariffs have also contributed to more volatility throughout the cryptocurrency landscape, with many global risk assets impacted by the uncertainty brought by the impact on trade.\
It may be that the impact of these macroeconomic pressures is pushing crypto lower in the short term, but could help Bitcoin to return to its cyclical rally in the months ahead.Could Skies be Set to Clear?Despite the impact of $TRUMP on the cryptocurrency landscape becoming the subject of much debate, the Trump administration continues to explore new projects within the ecosystem.\
The recent announcement by the Trump-backed venture World Liberty Financial that it would launch a strategic token reserve designed to boost the crypto market, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been a timely piece of good news to provide a boost to investors.\
Dubbed the ‘Macro Strategy’, the initiative could lead to a reserve that maintains a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) as a means of improving the quality of financial services offered throughout the fintech market.\
Another source of optimism stems from the announcement of the ‘DOGE Dividend’, which the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, suggested could come in the form of a $5,000 cheque sent to US taxpayers using the savings made by his department in 2026.\
This payout could provide a widespread cryptocurrency market boost akin to the rollout of government stimulus packages amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Is This The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?The cryptocurrency landscape has historically relied on Bitcoin’s halving cycle to chart out the coin’s market rallies. As the only metric that produced a consistent trend in a market that’s filled with volatility, Bitcoin’s cycles have been an excellent investment tool.\
However, the return of Donald Trump has seen an unprecedented level of attention fall on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. As a result, we’re seeing investor sentiment driven by many factors that fall outside of Bitcoin’s cycles.\
If Trump can continue to propel crypto further into the limelight then it’s likely to be bullish for the industry as a whole. But without the reliability of Bitcoin’s cycles, investors may need to find new ways to map out future bull runs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Firebase Studio: Everything You Need to Know About (4/21/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/4-21-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:10:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @fatman [ 3 Min read ]

On April 15, 2025, Solo Satoshi announced a pivotal milestone on X: over 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, contributing more than 10 petahashes of hashpower to bitcoin home miners globally. Fueled by a chaotic, unplanned flash sale, this achievement signals a global shift, with Bitaxe miners humming in homes from North America to Africa, Europe to Asia. These compact devices are bringing mining back to the people, enabling anyone to strengthen Bitcoin’s decentralized network. This article dives into the Bitaxe’s technology, its role in home mining, and the milestone that proves small bitcoin mining machines can reshape the future of Bitcoin.A Global Milestone for Home MiningThe sale of 10,000 Bitaxe miners marks a turning point for Bitcoin. Each miner represents an individual or small group bolstering the network’s security, collectively delivering over 10 petahashes (10 quadrillion hashes per second) of computational power. Operating in diverse settings, from rural cottages to urban apartments, these devices show that solo mining is not a relic; it’s a reality. The global spread of Bitaxe miners highlights a rising demand for accessible, efficient tools that empower everyday people to contribute to Bitcoin’s decentralized ecosystem.\
   This milestone was driven by a spontaneous flash sale for the Bitaxe Gamma, priced at $125.99. Launched on a whim by Solo Satoshi, the sale sparked a frenzy, pushing the company past the 10,000-device mark. Unlike the massive Antminer rigs dominating corporate mining farms, the Bitaxe offers a compact, energy-efficient option for home use. A weekly giveaway of a Bitaxe 601 Gamma with free global shipping followed, further expanding the device’s reach. As Bitcoin’s halving events reduce the block reward every four years, efficiency becomes critical, making the Bitaxe’s role increasingly vital.Solo Satoshi: Pioneering Access to BitaxeFounded in May 2024, Solo Satoshi is led by Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, a trio committed to making Bitcoin mining accessible. Matt’s strategic insight, Hunter’s technical knowledge, and Kelsie’s operational expertise drive the company’s efforts through their website, solosatoshi.com. As sellers of Bitaxe miners, they focus on connecting people with open-source bitcoin mining hardware, providing resources and a community hub for enthusiasts.The Open-Source Movement in Bitcoin MiningBitaxe is a product of the open-source movement, a core principle of Bitcoin’s philosophy. Created by @skot9000 (on X), the Bitaxe’s designs, schematics, and firmware are freely available on Github, inviting anyone with technical curiosity to build, modify, or enhance the device. This openness fosters a global community of developers and miners who share knowledge and drive innovation. Unlike proprietary systems that restrict users to rigid ecosystems, the Bitaxe encourages customization, making it a versatile tool for learning and contributing to Bitcoin’s security. \
   The open-source approach is gaining momentum as home miners seek alternatives to expensive, controlled hardware. By providing access to the Bitaxe’s blueprints, the community ensures mining remains inclusive, enabling hobbyists and small-scale miners to participate affordably. This movement aligns with Bitcoin’s values of transparency and decentralization, positioning the Bitaxe as a beacon of resistance against centralized control in mining.Centralization Fears in Bitcoin MiningLarge-scale mining operations have sparked concerns about Bitcoin’s decentralization. Insights from sources like Ocean (a decentralized mining pool) and other industry voices highlight key risks. First, the concentration of hashpower in a few major pools could enable collusion, allowing dominant players to manipulate transaction confirmations or prioritize specific transactions. Second, geographic centralization in regions with cheap electricity creates vulnerabilities to regulatory actions or natural disasters. Third, proprietary hardware limits innovation and locks miners into costly systems. Finally, the environmental impact of industrial mining, with its energy-intensive farms, has raised sustainability concerns.\
   The Bitaxe miner counters these issues by enabling individuals to contribute hashpower from their homes, reducing dependence on centralized pools. Its open-source design challenges proprietary hardware monopolies, and its low energy consumption supports greener mining practices. For those pursuing lottery mining (where a solo miner competes for the rare chance to mine a block and claim the full block reward), the Bitaxe provides a practical way to participate independently.The Bitaxe, instigated by @skot9000, is a compact, open-source Bitcoin mining device designed to make mining accessible to everyone. When it first appeared, few outside the open-source community recognized its potential, but Solo Satoshi, among the earliest adopters, championed it through sales on their website and the X platform, helping it reach thousands. The Bitaxe is engineered for home use, delivering 1.2 terahashes per second (TH/s) while consuming just 18 watts, a fraction of the power required by industrial miners. This efficiency makes it ideal for small-scale home mining setups, offering a stark contrast to the resource-heavy equipment of large operations.\
   The Bitaxe Gamma, exemplifies its user-friendly design. With plug-and-play functionality, beginners can connect the device to a power supply, change a few settings, and start mining bitcoin in minutes, no complex setup required. Advanced users benefit from its open-source nature, which allows customization, such as modifying firmware and the plethora of adjustments that can be made through AxeOS (The Bitaxe’s operating system). The Bitaxe’s compact size, 40mm fan, and very low heat output means it can run quietly on a desk or shelf, blending seamlessly into home environments. Unlike traditional miners that demand specialized cooling or infrastructure, the Bitaxe is built for simplicity and accessibility\
   Versatility is a hallmark of the Bitaxe. It supports solo mining, where miners compete independently for block rewards, as well as pool mining for more consistent payouts. Its affordability and efficiency appeal to hobbyists, educators, and those mining to support Bitcoin’s network rather than solely for profit. The device also doubles as an educational tool, helping users explore blockchain technology and mining mechanics hands-on. By distributing the Bitaxe, Solo Satoshi has made this technology widely available, enabling a new wave of miners to engage with Bitcoin’s ecosystem.The Rise of Home Mining: Plebs Take ChargeHome mining is experiencing a revival, powered by devices like the Bitaxe. In Bitcoin’s early days, anyone with a computer could mine, but rising difficulty shifted the landscape to industrial farms. The Bitaxe reverses this trend, allowing ordinary people to run miners from their homes, contributing to Bitcoin’s security. This movement is about more than earning rewards; it’s about upholding Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos.\
   The Bitaxe’s simplicity makes home mining feasible. With low power costs (comparable to a lightbulb) and minimal setup, it fits into any household. Miners need only a stable Wi-Fi and a small space, and the device’s quiet operation ensures it runs without disruption. For many, the excitement of solo mining, chasing the elusive block reward through lottery mining, is a driving force, but even pool miners strengthen the network’s resilience.\
  Stories of home miners illustrate the Bitaxe’s impact. A student in Tokyo mines from their dorm to learn about blockchain, while a retiree in Texas runs a Bitaxe to support Bitcoin’s mission. These plebs, as the Bitcoin community affectionately calls grassroots enthusiasts, are proving that small-scale mining matters. The 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, represent a growing network of home miners fortifying Bitcoin’s decentralization.A Bright Future for Bitaxe and BitcoinThe milestone of 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, powered by 10 petahashes and an anarchic flash sale, marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin mining. Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, through Solo Satoshi, have played a key role by distributing these devices globally, making them accessible to thousands. Their early support for Skot’s creation and their chaotic energy has helped the Bitaxe become a cornerstone of home mining.\
   As Bitcoin grapples with centralization and scalability challenges, the Bitaxe offers a path forward. It empowers individuals to contribute to the network, learn about bitcoin mining, and uphold Bitcoin’s decentralized principles. With every Bitaxe running in a home, the network grows stronger, more resilient, and truer to its roots. Visit solosatoshi.com to explore the Bitaxe and join the movement. Bitcoin’s future lies with the plebs; will you be one of them?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your Career Is Not Your Personality.

It’s fragile. And fragility breaks.\
They build  identity pillars—so when one crumbles, the whole thing doesn’t collapse.\

Eventually, some of those visitors will become customers.\
I want to share a strategy using dropped domains with backlinks that can bring you long-term web traffic.\
With this approach, I’ve been getting around 100 relevant, unique visitors each month — and it only cost me $36 (I bought three expired domains for a year).Getting new visitors to your site also helps improve your SEO by speeding up page indexing and boosting your rankings on Google.\
Dropped domains often come with backlinks from trusted, high-traffic websites. This is usually because the previous owners promoted the domain through articles, blog posts, videos, and by sharing links across various platforms.\
People still come across those old links and click on them. So if you find a dropped domain that’s still getting traffic, you can buy it and redirect those visitors to your own site.Getting new visitors to your site boost your SEOIf people read, click links, or share your pages, Google notices. Good engagement means good content and that helps your SEO.If people stay longer, it shows your site is useful. That helps rankings, especially in tough niches.Some visitors might link to or share your site.  still SEO gold.\
If new visitors bounce right away, it won’t help and could even hurt your SEO. It’s more about the quality of traffic than just the numbers.Relevant traffic is crucial for SEOIf your traffic isn’t relevant, visitors will quickly realize your site isn’t what they were looking for — and leave immediately.\
This behavior leads to a drop in metrics like Bounce Rate and Visit Duration, which can negatively impact your search rankings over time.Bounce Rate and which is normal?Bounce Rate is the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.\
For blogs, higher bounce rates are normal (people read 1 post and leave). For SaaS, tools, landing pages, you usually want it under 60%.Average Visit Duration and what value is normal?Average Visit Duration means how long people stay on your site on average.\
If your site is just a simple tool or info page, 45 seconds might be fine. But if it’s a content-rich site, you’d want longer.So, traffic from expired domains should be relevant.How to find domains with relevant trafficTo find domains with traffic and backlinks, you can use dropped domain platforms, expired domain services, or domain auctions. I personally prefer using , because it only crawls high-authority, high-traffic websites like Forbes, Medium, and Product Hunt.\
This means it offers high-quality dropped domains with solid backlinks that have a strong chance of still getting traffic. Plus, GoneDomains has helpful filters and data tools that make it easy to find the right domains in just a few clicks.Also it has AI tips, like “Get appraisal” which help to get domain appraisal, understand it value, business potential and in what kind of business domain can be used and so on. Very useful feature.When you find a domain you like, the next step is to check its backlinks. The backlinks should be related to your niche — this ensures the traffic is relevant and helps improve key metrics like Bounce Rate and Average Visit Duration.\
Improving these metrics has a positive impact on your overall SEO, including faster indexing and better search rankings.Setting up a right 301 redirectAfter when you find liked and suitable domains, you need to buy them and setting up a 301 redirect to your main domain.It did the same way but in different section in depends of your registrar, I use Cloudflare free redirect feature.https://gone.domains?ref=expiredomains.today
is called a URL parameter.So this URL is being used for referral tracking.It tells the website analytics that the visitor came from \n Tracking where traffic is coming fromAnalyzing which marketing channels are workingThis parameter is very important for analytics and for keeping track of domains with irrelevant traffic.Regularly check domain trafficCheck your domain’s traffic for relevance once a month. If you notice that a traffic source has a very low visit duration (less than 1 minute), it can negatively affect your SEO.\
You should identify and remove redirects from these low-quality traffic sources to your main site. Otherwise, they can hurt your SEO and impact your business in the long run.Calculation how much it costIt cost me just $36 to buy a bunch of expired domains with traffic for one year.\
They bring me 100 visitors per month, or 1,200 per year.\
At just $0.03 per visitor, it’s very cost-effective, especially when the traffic is real, organic-looking, and relevant.\
Most legitimate paid traffic options are more expensive, unless you’re really good at ad targeting or finding underpriced channels.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Exactly is an AI Agent? Examples and Counterexamples</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent-examples-and-counterexamples?source=rss</link><author>HeraHaven AI</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 02:03:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The term "AI agent" seems to be everywhere lately. From tech news headlines to business strategy discussions, it's rapidly becoming one of the most prominent terms in the artificial intelligence lexicon. Like many popular tech terms, however, its meaning can sometimes get diluted, leading to its use as a catch-all buzzword. So, what really constitutes an AI agent?\
At its core, the defining characteristic of an AI agent is its ability to autonomously perform actions to achieve a goal. This means they don't just process information or respond to direct commands; they interact with their environment (digital or physical), make decisions, and execute tasks with a degree of independence. Humans set the objectives, but the agent figures out the steps and takes them.The key differentiator for an AI agent is its capacity for autonomous action. While many AI tools can process information, generate text, or answer questions, an AI agent goes further. It perceives its environment, whether that's sensor data, user input, or information from the web or databases, and then uses that information to plan and execute actions. These actions could be digital, like sending emails, updating databases, executing trades, or triggering other processes, or physical, in the case of robots or self-driving cars.\
Crucially, this action-oriented nature requires capabilities like reasoning, planning, and often learning or adaptation. The agent needs to understand its goal, figure out the necessary steps, potentially use various tools (like APIs or web searches), and carry out those steps, sometimes correcting its course along the way. This distinguishes agents from simpler AI tools or assistants that primarily respond to user prompts or require human decision-making at each step. Merely gathering and presenting information, however sophisticatedly, doesn't meet this definition. The agent must do something based on that information, moving towards its objective without constant human intervention.When defined by autonomous action, several types of AI systems qualify as agents:Autonomous Driving Systems: Self-driving cars are a prime example. They perceive their environment (roads, obstacles, traffic signals) using sensors, plan navigation paths, and take actions (steering, braking, accelerating) to reach a destination safely.: These agents analyze market data in real-time, make decisions based on predefined (or learned) strategies, and autonomously execute buy or sell orders.Smart Home Controllers (with Action): While some smart home devices merely report status, a true agent might autonomously adjust thermostat settings based on occupancy patterns it learns, or proactively lock doors at a certain time, taking action rather than just providing information or waiting for a command.Autonomous Workflow Tools: Platforms like Auto-GPT or specialized agents built with frameworks like CrewAI aim to take a high-level goal (e.g., "research competitors and summarize findings") and break it down into subtasks, autonomously using tools like web browsers or APIs to gather information, analyze it, and compile a report. Replit Agent is another example that aims to build applications based on natural language prompts.Customer Service Agents (with Action Capability): While many chatbots only answer questions, more advanced agents can perform actions like processing refunds, changing passwords, or updating customer information in a CRM system, directly resolving issues instead of just providing instructions.Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enhanced with AI: Some advanced RPA systems incorporate AI agents that don't just follow pre-programmed rules but can adapt to changes, make decisions within a process, and handle more complex, multi-step workflows autonomously.Counterexamples: What Isn't an AI AgentUnderstanding what isn't an AI agent (under this action-oriented definition) helps clarify the concept:Standard Chatbots (like early ChatGPT): While highly capable at processing language and generating human-like text, chatbots that primarily respond to user prompts without autonomously initiating tasks or interacting with external systems beyond information retrieval generally don't qualify as agents. They react, but don't typically act proactively towards a persistent goal without continuous prompting. Systems that suggest products, movies, or news articles analyze data and make predictions, but they don't autonomously act on those recommendations (e.g., purchasing the item for you). The action relies on the user.Basic Data Analysis Tools: AI tools that analyze datasets and present insights, dashboards, or reports are providing information, not autonomously taking action based on those insights.AI-powered Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly): These tools enhance a user's actions (writing) by providing suggestions or corrections, but they don't autonomously write documents or send emails on the user's behalf based on a goal.Image Recognition Services: AI that identifies objects in images performs a sophisticated perception task but doesn't inherently take autonomous action based on that recognition.While "AI agent" is indeed a term enjoying significant buzz, understanding its core meaning – an AI tool capable of autonomous action towards a goal – is crucial. This ability to perceive, reason, plan, and act independently distinguishes true agents from many other valuable but less autonomous AI tools. As these technologies continue to evolve, recognizing this distinction will be key to understanding their capabilities and potential impact on various tasks and industries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quickly Extract Month Values in Excel with the MONTH Function</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/quickly-extract-month-values-in-excel-with-the-month-function?source=rss</link><author>Excel24x7</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 01:58:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The  function in Excel is used to extract the  from a given input date.
