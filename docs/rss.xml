The Guardian reports: A Soyuz capsule carrying the American and two Russian cosmonauts landed in Kazakhstan on Sunday, Pettit's birthday. "Today at 0420 Moscow time (0120 GMT), the Soyuz MS-26 landing craft with Alexei Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and Donald (Don) Pettit aboard landed near the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan," Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.
 
Spending 220 days in space, Pettit, Ovchinin and Vagner orbited the Earth 3,520 times and completed a journey of 93.3m miles over the course of their mission. It was the fourth spaceflight for Pettit, who has logged more than 18 months in orbit during his 29-year career. Nasa said in a statement that Pettit was "doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth." A recording of the touchdown can be viewed here.
 
Earlier this year, Pettit managed to take one of the best photos ever captured from space. "When I first saw it, I was dazzled by its beauty," wrote Ars Technica's Eric Berger. "But when I looked further into the image, there were just so many amazing details to be found."
 
"In this image, one can see the core of the Milky Way galaxy, zodiacal light (sunlight diffused by interplanetary dust), streaks of SpaceX Starlink satellites, individual stars, an edge-on view of the atmosphere that appears in burnt umber due to hydroxide emissions, a near-sunrise just over the horizon, and nighttime cities appearing as streaks."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Memorial for Pope Francis in Taiwan</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1sRY238wbE</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k1sRY238wbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 06:56:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Live view from a memorial for Pope Francis set up by the Taiwan Catholic Association in Taipei.

Your system doesn’t control it. So how do you know  when a payment goes through?A naive solution would be to keep asking Stripe every few seconds:Now imagine doing this for  on a site like Amazon. It just doesn’t scale and wastes server resources.Instead of your app repeatedly asking, what if Stripe could just tell you when the payment succeeds?In this article, we will explore:What does a Webhook request look like?How to setup a Webhook receiver?How to design a scalable Webhook infrastructure?A webhook is a simple way for one system (provider) to notify another system (receiver) in real time when an event happens using an HTTP request.Instead of one system asking repeatedly if something happened, the other system simply pushes the data as soon as the event is triggered.Let’s say you go to a busy restaurant.The host says: “There’s a 30-minute wait. Please leave your number, and we’ll text you when your table is ready.”You don’t need to stand at the counter asking every 2 minutes: “Is my table ready yet?”Instead, you walk away, and when your turn comes, they notify you automatically.That’s the idea behind webhooks.At a high level, webhooks work through registration, triggering, and delivery. Let’s walk through a real example to see what actually happens under the hood.Example: GitHub Webhook to Your AppLet’s say you’ve built a system that needs to react when someone opens a pull request (PR) in a GitHub repository — maybe to kick off a CI/CD pipeline, send a Slack notification, or run automated tests.Here’s how the webhook flow works step-by-step:Step 1: You Register a WebhookYou go to GitHub → Settings → WebhooksYou provide a  (e.g., https://myapp.com/github-webhook)You choose the  you care about, like , , or At this point, GitHub knows where to send data whenever those events occur.Step 2: GitHub Monitors EventsGitHub monitors its internal event stream for your repositoryWhen someone opens a new pull request, the event gets logged internallyStep 3: GitHub Sends a POST RequestGitHub prepares a  with details about the event: who opened the PR, which branch, repo metadata, etc.It makes a  request to your webhook URL:Step 4: Your Server Processes the EventYour app receives the requestYou verify the signature (to ensure it really came from GitHub)You process the payload — maybe enqueue it in a job queue, log it, or trigger business logicYou respond with an HTTP  to acknowledge receiptTo integrate with webhooks successfully, you need to understand what’s actually being sent to your server when the event occurs.Most webhook providers use the  to send event data to your server.Why POST? Because it allows the payload to be sent in the request body, which can include structured data (usually JSON) describing what happened.Rarely, some services allow , , or even , but  is the de facto standard for webhook delivery.The headers in a webhook request often include  and security-related information. Usually application/json (or sometimes application/x-www-form-urlencoded) Identifies the sender (e.g., Stripe/1.0, GitHub-Hookshot) Describes what type of event occurred (payment_intent.succeeded, pull_request, etc.)X-Signature / X-Hub-Signature: A hash of the payload using a secret key (HMAC) used to verify the request authenticity Unique ID for the webhook event (useful for logging/debugging)The body of a webhook request typically contains  in . This data includes what happened, when it happened, and which user/resource it’s related to.{

  "number": 42,

    "name": "awesome-project",
    "full_name": "octocat/awesome-project"

      "currency": "usd",
      "status": "succeeded"
    }
  },
  "livemode": false,
  "type": "payment_intent.succeeded"
}Once you’ve registered your webhook URL with a provider like GitHub or Stripe, the next step is to build a robust endpoint on your server that can receive and process these events reliably.This sounds simple — just receive a POST request, right?But in production, things get tricky:Webhooks might arrive orYour server might be , or briefly  might try to spoof requestsLet’s break down how to setup your webhook receiver the  way.Create a Dedicated EndpointStart by exposing a simple HTTP endpoint like:Accept only POST requestsAccept only JSON (via )Webhook events can be , , or even  by providers. Your handler must ensure that processing the same event  has no side effects.Every webhook event includes a  (e.g.,  in Stripe,  in GitHub)Store a record of processed IDs in a database or cacheBefore processing, check if the event ID has already been handledif (eventAlreadyProcessed(eventId)) {
    return 200 OK;
}This ensures , even if you receive the same event more than once.Handle HTTP Status Codes ProperlyReturn  after successful handlingReturn  if the payload is invalid or malformedAvoid 5xx errors unless something truly failed because most providers  on 5xx4.2 Security ConsiderationsWebhooks are public endpoints. That means anyone on the internet can POST to them. You must validate incoming requests.Verify the Signature (HMAC)Most providers include a  of the payload, using a shared secret. This ensures the payload came from the real source.You configure a webhook secret: Stripe signs the payload using HMAC-SHA256You verify the signature on your end:String expectedSignature = hmacSha256(secret, payload);

if (!expectedSignature.equals(signatureFromHeader)) {
    return 403 Forbidden;
}This prevents spoofed or forged webhooks.Whitelist Source IPs (Optional)Some providers publish static IP ranges from which webhooks are sent. You can optionally block all other IPs to tighten access.Downside: This adds DevOps complexity and can break things if IPs change.Don’t Expose Sensitive DataDon’t log full webhook payloads in plaintextDon’t return stack traces or internal errors in responsesDon’t include secrets or tokens in the response bodyAs your application grows and starts receiving thousands or even millions of webhook events daily, a simple synchronous handler won’t be enough.To make your webhook system reliable, fault-tolerant, and scalable, you need a design that’s asynchronous, decoupled, and observable.Let’s walk through how to build a production-grade webhook processing pipeline.5.1 Queue Incoming RequestsDon’t do heavy processing inside your webhook endpoint.Parse and validate the requestVerify its authenticity (signature, event ID, etc.)Immediately enqueue the event into a  like: (for high-throughput event pipelines) (lightweight and flexible) (serverless and easy to manage)This way, your server can return a fast , while actual processing happens in the background.5.2 Store Events for Audit & ReplayTo ensure traceability and recovery, store every incoming event in a database:Source info (e.g., IP address, headers)Status (, , )Use a durable data store like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or DynamoDB.This gives you the ability to  and .5.3 Process with Asynchronous WorkersBackground workers (or worker pools) pull events from the queue and perform actual business logic:Deduplicate the event using eventIDUpdate internal databases or call downstream servicesTrigger notifications or workflowsYou can scale them horizontallyYou gain control over load and processing rateYou isolate failures from the webhook endpointSometimes, event processing fails temporarily due to a database issue, timeout, or an unavailable downstream API.Your workers should  those events automatically, using a : (recommended): retry with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s…): retry every N seconds (e.g., retry every 30s): add randomness to avoid all retries happening at onceAlways limit retries and log failures after the final attempt.5.5 Use a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)If a webhook consistently fails after multiple retries, don’t keep retrying forever.Instead, send it to a , a special holding queue for problematic events.Investigate the root causeRetry manually after fixing the issueThis prevents bad events from clogging your pipeline and ensures no event is lost silently.5.6 Add Observability: Logs, Metrics & AlertsYou can’t fix what you can’t see. Add observability at every stage of the pipeline.Total webhook events received per hourRetry count and DLQ event countSudden drop in incoming eventsGrowing queue sizes (indicating backlog)Popular observability tools: (open-source),  (cloud-based) (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)With proper observability, you’ll catch issues early before they impact your users.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Go has made several interesting design decisions:It has virtually no Undefined Behavior.It has very simple GC semantics that they’re mostly stuck with due to design decisions in the surface language.These things mean that despite Go having a GC, it’s possible to do manual memory management in pure Go and in cooperation with the GC (although without any help from the  package). To demonstrate this, we will be building an untyped, garbage-collected arena abstraction in Go which relies on several GC implementation details.I would never play this kind of game in Rust or C++, because LLVM is extremely intelligent and able to find all kinds of ways to break you over the course of frequent compiler upgrades. On the other hand, although Go does not promise any compatibility across versions for code that imports , in practice, two forces work against Go doing this:Go prioritizes not breaking the ecosystem; this allows to assume that Hyrum’s Law will protect certain observable behaviors of the runtime, from which we may infer what can or cannot break easily.This is in contrast to a high-performance native compiler like LLVM, which has a carefully defined boundary around all UB, allowing them to arbitrarily break programs that cross it (mostly) without fear of breaking the ecosystem.So, let’s dive in and cheat death.Our goal is to build an , which is a data structure for efficient allocation of memory that has the same lifetime. This reduces pressure on the general-purpose allocator by only requesting memory in large chunks and then freeing it all at once.For a comparison in Go, consider the following program:This program will print successive powers of 2: this is because  is implemented approximately like so:For appending small pieces,  is only called  times, a big improvement over calling it for every call to . Virtually every programming language’s dynamic array abstraction makes this optimization.An arena generalizes this concept, but instead of resizing exponentially, it allocates  blocks and vends pointers into them. The interface we want to conform to is as follows:In go a size and and an alignment, out comes a pointer fresh memory with that layout. Go does not have user-visible uninitialized memory, so we additionally require that the returned region be zeroed. We also require that  be a power of two.We can give this a type-safe interface by writing a generic  function:This all feels very fine and dandy to anyone used to hurting themselves with  or  in C++, but there is a small problem. What happens when we allocate pointer-typed memory into this allocator? takes a size and an alignment, which is sufficient to describe the  of any type. For example, on 64-bit systems,  and  have the same layout: 8 bytes of size, and 8 bytes of alignment.However, the Go GC (and all garbage collectors, generally) require one additional piece of information, which is somewhere between the layout of a value (how it is placed in memory) and the type of a value (rich information on its structure). To understand this, we need a brief overview on what a GC does.For a complete overview on how to build a simple GC, take a look at a toy GC I designed some time ago: The Alkyne GC.A garbage collector’s responsibility is to maintain a memory allocator and an accounting of:What memory has been allocated.Whether that memory is still in use.Memory that is not in use can be reclaimed and marked as unallocated, for re-use.The most popular way to accomplish this is via a “mark and sweep” architecture. The GC will periodically walk the entire object graph of the program from certain pre-determined ; anything it finds is “marked” as alive. After a mark is complete, all other memory is “swept”, which means to mark it is unallocated for future re-use, or to return it to the OS, in the case of significant surplus.The roots are typically entities that are actively being manipulated by the program. In the case of Go, this is anything currently on the stack of some G, or anything in a global (of which there is a compile-time-known set).The marking phase begins with , which looks at the stack of each G and locates any pointers contained therein. The Go compiler generates metadata for each function that specifies which stack slots in a function’s frame contain pointers. All of these pointers are live by definition.These pointers are placed into a queue, and each pointer is traced to its allocation on the heap. If the GC does not know anything about a particular address, it is discarded as foreign memory that does not need to be marked. If it does, each pointer in that allocation is pushed onto the queue if it has not already been marked as alive. The process continues until the queue is empty.The critical step here is to take the address of some allocation, and convert it into all of the pointer values within. Go has precise garbage collection, which means that it only treats things declared as pointers in the surface language as pointers: an integer that happens to look like an address will not result in sweeping. This results in more efficient memory usage, but trades off some more complexity in the GC.For example, the types , , ,  all contain at least one pointer, while , , struct {X bool; F uintptr} do not. The latter are called  types.Go enhances the layout of a type into a  by adding a bitset that specifies which pointer-aligned, pointer-sized words of the type’s memory region contain a pointer. These are called the . For example, here are the shapes of a few Go types on a 64-bit system.In the Go GC, each allocation is tagged with its shape (this is done in a variety of ways in the GC, either through an explicit header on the allocation, itself (a “malloc header”), a runtime type stored in the allocation’s , or another mechanism). When scanning a value, it uses this information to determine where the pointers to scan through are.The most obvious problem with our  type is that it does not discriminate shapes, so it cannot allocate memory that contains pointers: the GC will not be able to find the pointers, and will free them prematurely!In our example where we allocated an  in our custom allocator, we wind up with a  on the stack. You would think that Go would simply trace through the first  to find an  and mark it as being alive, but that is not what happens! Go instead finds a pointer into some chunk that the custom allocator grabbed from the heap, which is missing the pointer bits of its shape!Why does go not look at the type of the pointer it steps through? Two reasons.All pointers in Go are untyped from the runtime’s perspective; every  gets erased into an . This allows much of the Go runtime to be “generic” without using actual generics.Pointee metadata can be aggregated, so that each pointer to an object does not have to remember its type at runtime.The end result for us is that we can’t put pointers on the arena. This makes our  API unsafe, especially since Go does not provide a standard constraint for marking generic parameters as pointer-free: unsurprisingly, the don’t expect most users to care about such a detail.It  possible to deduce the pointer bits of a type using reflection, but that’s very slow, and the whole point of using arenas is to go fast. As we design our arena, though, it will become clear that there is a safe way to have pointers on it.Now that we have a pretty good understanding about what the Go GC is doing, we can go about designing a fast arena structure.The ideal case is that a call to  is very fast: just offsetting a pointer in the common case. One assumption we can make off the bat is that all memory can be forced to have maximum alignment: most objects are a pointer or larger, and Go does have a maximum alignment for ordinary user types, so we can just ignore the  parameter and always align to say, 8 bytes. This means that the pointer to the next unallocated chunk will always be well-aligned. Thus, we might come up with a structure like this one:How fast is this really? Here’s a simple benchmark for it.The focus of this benchmark is to measure the cost of allocating many objects of the same size. The number of times the  loop will execute is unknown, and determined by the benchmarking framework to try to reduce statistical anomaly. This means that if we instead just benchmark a single allocation, the result will be  sensitive to the number of runs.We also use  to get a throughput measurement on the benchmark. This is a bit easier to interpret than the gross , the benchmark would otherwise produce. It tells us how much memory each allocator can allocate per unit time.We want to compare against , but just writing  will get optimized out, since the resulting pointer does not escape. Writing it to a global is sufficient to convince Go that it escapes.Here’s the results, abbreviated to show only the bytes per second. All benchmarks were performed on my AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X. Larger is better.This is quite nice, and certainly worth pursuing! The performance increase seems to scale up with the amount of memory allocated, for a 2x-4x improvement across different cases.Now we need to contend with the fact that our implementation is completely broken if we want to have pointers in it.In , when we assign a freshly-allocated chunk, we overwrite , which means the GC can reclaim it. But this is fine: as long as pointers into that arena chunk are alive, the GC will not free it, independent of the arena. So it seems like we don’t need to worry about it?However, the whole point of an arena is to allocate lots of memory that has the same lifetime. This is common for graph data structures, such as an AST or a compiler IR, which performs a lot of work that allocates a lot and then throws the result away.We are not allowed to put pointers in the arena, because they would disappear from the view of the GC and become freed too soon. But, if a pointer wants to go on an arena, it necessarily outlive the whole arena, since it outlives part of the arena, and the arena is meant to have the same lifetime.In particular, if we could make it so that holding any pointer returned by  prevents the  from being swept by the GC, the arena can safely contain pointers into itself! Consider this:We have a pointer . It is allocated on some arena .The GC sees our pointer (as a type-erased ) and marks its allocation as live.Somehow, the GC also marks  as alive as a consequence.Somehow, the GC then marks every chunk  has allocated as alive.Therefore he chunk that  points to is also alive, so  does not need to be marked directly, and will not be freed early.The step (3) is crucial. By forcing the whole arena to be marked, any pointers stored in the arena into itself will be kept alive automatically, without the GC needing to know how to scan for them.So, even though  is still going to result in a use-after-free, *New[*int](a) = New[int](a) would not! This small improvement does not make arenas themselves safe, but a data structure with an internal arena can be completely safe, so long as the only pointers that go into the arena are from the arena itself.How can we make this work? The easy part is (4), which we can implement by adding a  to the arena, and sticking every pointer we allocate into it.The cost of the  is amortized: to allocate  bytes, we wind up allocating an additional  times. But what does this do to our benchmarks?Seems pretty much the same, which is a good sign.Now that the arena does not discard any allocated memory, we can focus on condition (3): making it so that if any pointer returned by  is alive, then so is the whole arena.Here we can make use of an important property of how Go’s GC works: any pointer into an allocation will keep it alive, as well as anything reachable from that pointer. But the chunks we’re allocating are s, which will not be scanned. If there could  be a single pointer in this slice that was scanned, we would be able to stick the pointer  there, and so when anything that  returns is scanned, it would cause  to be marked as alive.So far, we have been allocating  using , but we would actually like to allocate struct { A [N]uintptr; P unsafe.Pointer }, where  is some dynamic value.In its infintie wisdom, the Go standard library actually gives us a dedicated mechanism to do this: . This can be used to construct arbitrary anonymous  types at runtime, which we can then allocate on the heap.So, instead of calling , we might call this function:This appears to have a minor but noticeable effect on performance.Looking back at , the end of this function has a branch:This is the absolute hottest part of allocation, since it is executed every time we call this function. The branch is a bit unfortunate, but it’s necessary, as noted by the comment.In C++, if we have an array of  with  elements in it, and  is a pointer to the start of the array,  is a valid pointer, even though it can’t be dereferenced; it points “one past the end” of the array. This is a useful construction, since, for example, you can use it to eliminate a loop induction variable:Go, however, gets very upset if you do this, because it confuses the garbage collector. The GC can’t tell the difference between a one-past-the-end pointer for allocation A, and for the start of allocation B immediately after it. At best this causes memory to stay alive for longer, and at worst it triggers safety interlocks in the GC. The GC will panic if it happens to scan a pointer for an address that it knows has been freed.But in our code above, every chunk now has an extra element at the very end that is not used for allocation, so we  have a pointer that  one-past-the-end of the  that we are vending memory from.The updated allocation function would look like this:Notably, we do not replace  with an end pointer, because of the  comparison. We can’t actually avoid the subtraction  because we would have to do it to make this comparison work if we got rid of .So how much better is this?Remarkably, not very! This is an improvement on the order of magnitude of one or two percentage points. This is because the branch we deleted is extremely predictable.Turns out there’s a bigger improvement we can make.Here’s the assembly Go generated for this function, heavily abridged, and annotated with the corresponding Go source code.There’s a lot going on in this function, but most of it is a mix of Go not being great at register allocation, and lots of .A write barrier is a mechanism for synchronizing ordinary user code with the GC. Go generates code for one any time a non-pointer-free type is stored. For example, writing to a , , or  requires a write barrier.Write barriers are implemented as follows: is checked, which determines whether the write barrier is necessary, which is only when the GC is in the mark phase. Otherwise the branch is taken to skip the write barrier.A call to one of the  functions happens.  is the number of pointers that the GC needs to be informed of.This function calls , which returns a buffer onto which pointers the GC needs to now trace through should be written to.The actual store happens.A write barrier is required for a case like the following. Consider the following code.This function will call  to allocate eight bytes of memory. The resulting pointer will be returned in . This function then stores  into  and returns. If we Godbolt this function, we’ll find that it does, in fact, generate a write barrier:Note that two pointers get written: the pointer returned by , and the old value of . This ensures that regardless of where in this function the GC happens to be scanning through , it sees both values during the mark phase.Now, this isn’t necessary if the relevant pointers are already reachable in some other way… which is exactly the case in our arena (thanks to the  slice). So the write barrier in the fast path is redundant.But, how do we get rid of it? There is a , but that’s not allowed outside of a list of packages allowlisted in the compiler. It also doens’t disable write barriers; it simply generates a diagnostic if any are emitted.But remember, write barriers only occur when storing pointer-typed memory… so we can just replace  with . hates this, because it doesn’t know that we’re smarter than it is. Does This make the code faster? To make it a little bit more realistic, I’ve written a separate variant of the benchmarks that hammers the GC really hard in a separate G:The result indicates that this is a worthwhile optimization for churn-heavy contexts. Performance is much worse overall, but that’s because the GC is pre-empting everyone. The improvement seems to be on the order of 20% for very small allocations.Before
After
Go does not offer an easy mechanism to “reallocate” an allocation, as with  in C. This is because it has no mechanism for freeing pointers explicitly, which is necessary for a reallocation abstraction.But we already don’t care about safety, so we can offer reallocation on our arena. Now, the reallocation we can offer is quite primitive: if a chunk happens to be the most recent one allocated, we can grow it. Otherwise we just allocate a new chunk and don’t free the old one.This makes it possible to implement “arena slices” that can be constructed by appending, which will not trigger reallocation on slice growth as long as nothing else gets put on the arena. would look something like this:Then, whenever we append to our arena slice, we can call  to grow it. However, this does not work if the slice’s base pointer is not the original address returned by  or . It is an exercise for the reader to:Implement a  type that uses an arena for allocation.Make this work for any value of  within the most recent allocation, not just the base offset. This requires extra book-keeping.Here is the entirety of the code that we have developed, not including the reallocation function above.There are other optimizations that we could make here that I haven’t discussed. For example, arenas could be re-used; once an arena is done, it could be “reset” and placed into a . This arena would not need to go into the GC to request new chunks, re-using the ones previously allocated (and potentially saving on the cost of zeroing memory over and over again).I did say that this relies very heavily on Go’s internal implementation details. Whats the odds that they get broken in the future? Well, the requirement that allocations know their shape is forced by the existence of , and the requirement that a pointer into any part of an allocation keeps the whole thing alive essentially comes from slices being both sliceable and mutable; once a slice escapes to the heap (and thus multiple goroutines) coordinating copies for shrinking a slice would require much more complexity than the current write barrier implementation.And in my opinion, it’s pretty safe to say that Hyrum’s Law has us covered here. ;)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Mass in the Philippines after the death of Pope Francis</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gruODIzZ4Kk</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gruODIzZ4Kk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 03:33:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Mass is held at the Manila Cathedral in the Philippines after Pope Francis died at age 88.

Off one atoll, just south of the Maldives' capital, Male, researchers are testing one way to capture sand in strategic locations -- to grow islands, rebuild beaches, and protect coastal communities from sea-level rise. Swim 10 minutes out into the En'boodhoofinolhu Lagoon and you'll find the Ramp Ring, an unusual structure made up of six tough-skinned geotextile bladders. These submerged bags, part of a recent effort called the Growing Islands project, form a pair of parentheses separated by 90meters (around 300 feet). The bags, each about two meters tall, were deployed in December 2024, and by February, underwater images showed that sand had climbed about a meter and a half up the surface of each one, demonstrating how passive structures can quickly replenish beaches and, in time, build a solid foundation for new land. "There's just a ton of sand in there. It's really looking good," says Skylar Tibbits, an architect and founder of the MIT Self-Assembly Lab, which is developing the project in partnership with the Male-based climate tech company Invena.
 
The Self-Assembly Lab designs material technologies that can be programmed to transform or "self-assemble" in the air or underwater, exploiting natural forces like gravity, wind, waves, and sunlight. Its creations include sheets of wood fiber that form into three-dimensional structures when splashed with water, which the researchers hope could be used for tool-free flat-pack furniture.Growing Islands is their largest-scale undertaking yet. Since 2017, the project has deployed 10 experiments in the Maldives, testing different materials, locations, and strategies, including inflatable structures and mesh nets. The Ramp Ring is many times larger than previous deployments and aims to overcome their biggest limitation.
 
In the Maldives, the direction of the currents changes with the seasons. Past experiments have been able to capture only one seasonal flow, meaning they lie dormant for months of the year. By contrast, the Ramp Ring is "omnidirectional," capturing sand year-round. "It's basically a big ring, a big loop, and no matter which monsoon season and which wave direction, it accumulates sand in the same area," Tibbits says. The approach points to a more sustainable way to protect the archipelago, whose growing population is supported by an economy that caters to 2 million annual tourists drawn by its white beaches and teeming coral reefs. Most of the country's 187 inhabited islands have already had some form of human intervention to reclaim land or defend against erosion, such as concrete blocks, jetties, and breakwaters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Pope Francis achieved, and will the next leader reverse his changes | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-VSX7HIE2Y</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H-VSX7HIE2Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 03:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chapters:

These believable yet fake packages, representing almost 20% of the samples tested, can be registered by attackers to distribute malicious code. CSO Online reports: Slopsquatting, as researchers are calling it, is a term first coined by Seth Larson, a security developer-in-residence at Python Software Foundation (PSF), for its resemblance to the typosquatting technique. Instead of relying on a user's mistake, as in typosquats, threat actors rely on an AI model's mistake. A significant number of packages, amounting to 19.7% (205,000 packages), recommended in test samples were found to be fakes. Open-source models -- like DeepSeek and WizardCoder -- hallucinated more frequently, at 21.7% on average, compared to the commercial ones (5.2%) like GPT 4. Researchers found CodeLlama ( hallucinating over a third of the outputs) to be the worst offender, and GPT-4 Turbo ( just 3.59% hallucinations) to be the best performer.
 
These package hallucinations are particularly dangerous as they were found to be persistent, repetitive, and believable. When researchers reran 500 prompts that had previously produced hallucinated packages, 43% of hallucinations reappeared every time in 10 successive re-runs, with 58% of them appearing in more than one run. The study concluded that this persistence indicates "that the majority of hallucinations are not just random noise, but repeatable artifacts of how the models respond to certain prompts." This increases their value to attackers, it added. Additionally, these hallucinated package names were observed to be "semantically convincing." Thirty-eight percent of them had moderate string similarity to real packages, suggesting a similar naming structure. "Only 13% of hallucinations were simple off-by-one typos," Socket added. The research can found be in a paper on arXiv.org (PDF).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis’ apartment is sealed with red ribbon and wax after his death</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phyuwp5fo74</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Phyuwp5fo74?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 01:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis’ formal apartment in the Vatican has been sealed in a ritual that is a key part of the tradition after a pope dies.

Which would you choose when, and why? Both seemingly accomplish the exact same thing with minor tradeoffs.In this case, I'm looking at this specifically in defining the capabilities provided in a domain-driven design. For example:go type SesssionCreator interface { CreateSession(Session) error } type SessionReader interface { ReadSession(id string) (Session, error) } go type ( CreateSessionFunc(Session) error ReadSessionFunc(id string) (Session, error) ) And, then in some consumer, e.g., an HTTP handler:```go func PostSession(store identity.SessionCreator) HttpHandlerFunc { return func(req Request) { store.CreateSession(s) } }func PostSession(createSession identity.CreateSessionFunc) HttpHandlerFunc { return func(req Request) { createSession(s) } } ```I think in simple examples like this, functions seem simpler than interfaces, the test will be shorter and easier to read, and so on. It gets more ambiguous when the consumer function performs multiple actions, e.g.:```go func PostSomething(store interface{ identity.SessionReader catalog.ItemReader execution.JobCreator }) HttpHandlerFunc { return func(req Request) { // Use store } }func PostSomething( readSession identity.ReadSessionFunc, readItem catalog.ReadItemFunc, createJob execution.CreateJobFunc, ) HttpHandlerFunc { return func(req Request) { // use individual functions } } ```And, on the initiating side of this, assuming these are implemented by some aggregate "store" repository:go router.Post("/things", PostSomething(store)) // vs router.Post("/things", PostSomething(store.ReadSession, store.ReadItem, store.CreateJob) I'm sure there are lots of edge cases and reasons for one approach over the other. Idiomatic naming for a lot of small, purposeful interfaces in Go with  can get a bit wonky sometimes. What else? Which approach would you take, and why?

When Francis took office, the Church was in deep crisis. Thousands of victims had come forward. The pattern was clear: abuse by priests, and cover-ups at the highest levels. Francis promised zero tolerance. He met with survivors, created a special commission in the Vatican, and introduced new rules to hold bishops accountable. But critics say it wasn’t enough. That enforcement was weak and transparency came slowly. And for many survivors, justice never arrived.

One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code.The origins of the sidecar patternThink of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice.
With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems.Kubernetes implementationIn Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within
the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing.
Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and
this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1.29.0, which introduced
native support for sidecars.
Sidecar containers can now be defined within a Pod manifest using the  field. What makes
it a sidecar container is that you specify it with . You can see an example of this below, which is a partial snippet of the full Kubernetes manifest:That field name,  may sound confusing. How come when you want to define a sidecar container, you have to put an entry in the  array?  are run to completion just before main application starts, so they’re one-off, whereas sidecars often run in parallel to the main app container. It’s the  with  which differs classic init containers from Kubernetes-native sidecar containers and ensures they are always up.When to embrace (or avoid) sidecarsWhile the sidecar pattern can be useful in many cases, it is generally not the preferred approach unless the use case justifies it. Adding a sidecar increases complexity, resource consumption, and potential network latency. Instead, simpler alternatives such as built-in libraries or shared infrastructure should be considered first.You need to extend application functionality without touching the original codeImplementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring or securityWorking with legacy applications requiring modern networking capabilitiesDesigning microservices that demand independent scaling and updatesResource efficiency is your primary concernMinimal network latency is criticalSimpler alternatives existYou want to minimize troubleshooting complexityFour essential multi-container patternsThe  pattern is used to execute (often critical) setup tasks before the main application container starts. Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion and then terminate, ensuring that preconditions for the main application are met.Verifying dependency availabilityRunning database migrationsThe init container ensures your application starts in a predictable, controlled environment without code modifications.An ambassador container provides Pod-local helper services that expose a simple way to access a network service. Commonly, ambassador containers send network requests on behalf of a an application container and
take care of challenges such as service discovery, peer identity verification, or encryption in transit.Perfect when you need to:Offload client connectivity concernsImplement language-agnostic networking featuresAdd security layers like TLSCreate robust circuit breakers and retry mechanismsA  sidecar provides configuration updates to an application dynamically, ensuring it always has access to the latest settings without disrupting the service. Often the helper needs to provide an initial
configuration before the application would be able to start successfully.Fetching environment variables and secretsPolling configuration changesDecoupling configuration management from application logicAn  (or sometimes ) container enables interoperability between the main application container and external services. It does this by translating data formats, protocols, or APIs.Transforming legacy data formatsBridging communication protocolsFacilitating integration between mismatched servicesWhile sidecar patterns offer tremendous flexibility, they're not a silver bullet. Each added sidecar introduces complexity, consumes resources, and potentially increases operational overhead. Always evaluate simpler alternatives first.
The key is strategic implementation: use sidecars as precision tools to solve specific architectural challenges, not as a default approach. When used correctly, they can improve security, networking, and configuration management in containerized environments.
Choose wisely, implement carefully, and let your sidecars elevate your container ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China&apos;s CATL Says It Has Overtaken BYD On 5-Minute EV Charging Time</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/2049235/chinas-catl-says-it-has-overtaken-byd-on-5-minute-ev-charging-time?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CATL has unveiled a second-generation Shenxing battery capable of delivering a 520km range in just five minutes of charging, surpassing BYD's recent breakthrough and positioning both Chinese firms ahead of Western rivals in EV battery tech. The battery manufacturer also introduced a sodium-ion battery called Naxtra, offering up to 500km range for EVs and potential to diversify global energy resources. The Financial Times reports: The claims by the Chinese battery groups would put them ahead of major western rivals. At present, Tesla vehicles can be charged up to 200 miles (321km) in added range in 15 minutes, while Germany's Mercedes-Benz recently launched its all-electric CLA compact sedan, which can be charged for up to 325km within 10 minutes using a fast-charging station. [...] The second generation of the Shenxing battery, which boasts a range of 800km on one charge, can achieve a peak charging speed of 2.5km per second, the company said at a media event ahead of this week's Shanghai auto show.
 
"We look forward to collaborating with more industry leaders to push the limits of supercharging through true innovation," said CATL's chief technology officer Gao Huan, adding that he wanted the new batteries to become "the standard for electric vehicles." Analysts at Bernstein said the latest progress meant that charging speeds had more than doubled in the past year and "increased tenfold over the past 3-4 years." Huan said the new Shenxing battery would be installed in more than 67 EV models this year. He later told reporters that energy density would not be sacrificed as a trade-off for fast charging.
 
During its tech day, CATL also unveiled its new sodium-ion battery, which it said would go into mass production in December. The battery brand called Naxtra is able to give a range of about 200km for a hybrid vehicle and 500km for an electric vehicle, according to Huan. [...] At the event, Huan claimed the new sodium-ion battery would enable the industry's shift from "single resource dependence" to "energy freedom" and reshape the global energy landscape. He added that he was in discussions with several companies about using sodium-ion batteries in their vehicles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Mass held in Argentina where Pope Francis received his religious calling</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4THGyMDtb0</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z4THGyMDtb0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:36:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as Archbishop Jorge Ignacio Garcia Cuerva holds Mass at Basílica de San José de Flores in Buenos Aires, where Pope Francis said he received his religious calling at age 17.

We are looking to introduce service mesh in our environment, while evaluating multiple meshes we came across istio and kuma both being a good fit for multi-cluster environment. On one hand kuma looks to be very easy to setup and built with multi-cluster architecture. Though docs are lacking a lot of information and don’t see much community support either. On the other hand istio has been battle tested in multiple production environments and has a great community support and documentations. Though multi-cluster setup is more sort of extension than built in capability. Also, various tools required to manage configs and visualise metrics. We would want capabilities to control traffic effectively and ability to load balance between multiple cluster not being connected directly ( separate vpc with peering and non-peering connections). And ability to be able add a new cluster as we want. Is there anyone here who has used istio or kuma multi-cluster. Also, please do share your experience with either of them in managing, debugging and upgrading them. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump, Putin, JD Vance, Claudia Sheinbaum react to the death of Pope Francis</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWnhGbG8b7A</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AWnhGbG8b7A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:05:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Church bells tolled in mourning.

When these drives reach the end of their useful lives, they are usually shredded, and the key materials they're made of -- including several rare earth elements (REE) -- end up as e-waste. At the same time, countries are mining these same materials and emitting a lot of greenhouse gases in the process. And China, a major source of REE, recently announced export restrictions on seven of them, potentially limiting the U.S. tech industry's access to materials such as dysprosium, which is necessary for magnetic storage, motors, and generators.
 
[On Thursday], Western Digital announced that it has created a large-scale hard disk drive recycling program in concert with Microsoft and recycling-industry partners CMR (Critical Materials Recycling) and PedalPoint Recycling. The new process reclaims Rare Earth Oxides (REO) containing dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium from hard drives, along with aluminum, steel, gold, palladium, and copper. The REO reclamation takes place completely within the U.S. and those materials go back into the U.S. market.
 
Dubbed the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, WD's initiative has already saved 47,000 pounds worth of hard drives, SSDs, and caddies from landfills or less-effective recycling programs. WD was able to achieve a more than 90% reclaim rate for REE and an 80% rate for all of the shredded material. The drives came from Microsoft's U.S. data centers where they were first shredded and then sent to PedalPoint for sorting and processing. Magnets and steel were then sent to CMR, which uses its acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) technology to extract the rare earth elements.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks, Bonds Sink in Broad Retreat From US Assets | Bloomberg: The Close 04/21/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ30LWKgaws</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lJ30LWKgaws?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:37:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg Television brings you the latest news and analysis leading up to the final minutes and seconds before and after the closing bell on Wall Street.

From a report: A week ago, a Microsoft executive said the software company was slowing down or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom. 

"Over the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones)," Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note.

Go has made several interesting design decisions:It has virtually no Undefined Behavior.It has very simple GC semantics that they’re mostly stuck with due to design decisions in the surface language.These things mean that despite Go having a GC, it’s possible to do manual memory management in pure Go and in cooperation with the GC (although without any help from the  package). To demonstrate this, we will be building an untyped, garbage-collected arena abstraction in Go which relies on several GC implementation details.I would never play this kind of game in Rust or C++, because LLVM is extremely intelligent and able to find all kinds of ways to break you over the course of frequent compiler upgrades. On the other hand, although Go does not promise any compatibility across versions for code that imports , in practice, two forces work against Go doing this:Go prioritizes not breaking the ecosystem; this allows to assume that Hyrum’s Law will protect certain observable behaviors of the runtime, from which we may infer what can or cannot break easily.This is in contrast to a high-performance native compiler like LLVM, which has a carefully defined boundary around all UB, allowing them to arbitrarily break programs that cross it (mostly) without fear of breaking the ecosystem.So, let’s dive in and cheat death.Our goal is to build an , which is a data structure for efficient allocation of memory that has the same lifetime. This reduces pressure on the general-purpose allocator by only requesting memory in large chunks and then freeing it all at once.For a comparison in Go, consider the following program:This program will print successive powers of 2: this is because  is implemented approximately like so:For appending small pieces,  is only called  times, a big improvement over calling it for every call to . Virtually every programming language’s dynamic array abstraction makes this optimization.An arena generalizes this concept, but instead of resizing exponentially, it allocates  blocks and vends pointers into them. The interface we want to conform to is as follows:In go a size and and an alignment, out comes a pointer fresh memory with that layout. Go does not have user-visible uninitialized memory, so we additionally require that the returned region be zeroed. We also require that  be a power of two.We can give this a type-safe interface by writing a generic  function:This all feels very fine and dandy to anyone used to hurting themselves with  or  in C++, but there is a small problem. What happens when we allocate pointer-typed memory into this allocator? takes a size and an alignment, which is sufficient to describe the  of any type. For example, on 64-bit systems,  and  have the same layout: 8 bytes of size, and 8 bytes of alignment.However, the Go GC (and all garbage collectors, generally) require one additional piece of information, which is somewhere between the layout of a value (how it is placed in memory) and the type of a value (rich information on its structure). To understand this, we need a brief overview on what a GC does.For a complete overview on how to build a simple GC, take a look at a toy GC I designed some time ago: The Alkyne GC.A garbage collector’s responsibility is to maintain a memory allocator and an accounting of:What memory has been allocated.Whether that memory is still in use.Memory that is not in use can be reclaimed and marked as unallocated, for re-use.The most popular way to accomplish this is via a “mark and sweep” architecture. The GC will periodically walk the entire object graph of the program from certain pre-determined ; anything it finds is “marked” as alive. After a mark is complete, all other memory is “swept”, which means to mark it is unallocated for future re-use, or to return it to the OS, in the case of significant surplus.The roots are typically entities that are actively being manipulated by the program. In the case of Go, this is anything currently on the stack of some G, or anything in a global (of which there is a compile-time-known set).The marking phase begins with , which looks at the stack of each G and locates any pointers contained therein. The Go compiler generates metadata for each function that specifies which stack slots in a function’s frame contain pointers. All of these pointers are live by definition.These pointers are placed into a queue, and each pointer is traced to its allocation on the heap. If the GC does not know anything about a particular address, it is discarded as foreign memory that does not need to be marked. If it does, each pointer in that allocation is pushed onto the queue if it has not already been marked as alive. The process continues until the queue is empty.The critical step here is to take the address of some allocation, and convert it into all of the pointer values within. Go has precise garbage collection, which means that it only treats things declared as pointers in the surface language as pointers: an integer that happens to look like an address will not result in sweeping. This results in more efficient memory usage, but trades off some more complexity in the GC.For example, the types , , ,  all contain at least one pointer, while , , struct {X bool; F uintptr} do not. The latter are called  types.Go enhances the layout of a type into a  by adding a bitset that specifies which pointer-aligned, pointer-sized words of the type’s memory region contain a pointer. These are called the . For example, here are the shapes of a few Go types on a 64-bit system.In the Go GC, each allocation is tagged with its shape (this is done in a variety of ways in the GC, either through an explicit header on the allocation, itself (a “malloc header”), a runtime type stored in the allocation’s , or another mechanism). When scanning a value, it uses this information to determine where the pointers to scan through are.The most obvious problem with our  type is that it does not discriminate shapes, so it cannot allocate memory that contains pointers: the GC will not be able to find the pointers, and will free them prematurely!In our example where we allocated an  in our custom allocator, we wind up with a  on the stack. You would think that Go would simply trace through the first  to find an  and mark it as being alive, but that is not what happens! Go instead finds a pointer into some chunk that the custom allocator grabbed from the heap, which is missing the pointer bits of its shape!Why does go not look at the type of the pointer it steps through? Two reasons.All pointers in Go are untyped from the runtime’s perspective; every  gets erased into an . This allows much of the Go runtime to be “generic” without using actual generics.Pointee metadata can be aggregated, so that each pointer to an object does not have to remember its type at runtime.The end result for us is that we can’t put pointers on the arena. This makes our  API unsafe, especially since Go does not provide a standard constraint for marking generic parameters as pointer-free: unsurprisingly, the don’t expect most users to care about such a detail.It  possible to deduce the pointer bits of a type using reflection, but that’s very slow, and the whole point of using arenas is to go fast. As we design our arena, though, it will become clear that there is a safe way to have pointers on it.Now that we have a pretty good understanding about what the Go GC is doing, we can go about designing a fast arena structure.The ideal case is that a call to  is very fast: just offsetting a pointer in the common case. One assumption we can make off the bat is that all memory can be forced to have maximum alignment: most objects are a pointer or larger, and Go does have a maximum alignment for ordinary user types, so we can just ignore the  parameter and always align to say, 8 bytes. This means that the pointer to the next unallocated chunk will always be well-aligned. Thus, we might come up with a structure like this one:How fast is this really? Here’s a simple benchmark for it.The focus of this benchmark is to measure the cost of allocating many objects of the same size. The number of times the  loop will execute is unknown, and determined by the benchmarking framework to try to reduce statistical anomaly. This means that if we instead just benchmark a single allocation, the result will be  sensitive to the number of runs.We also use  to get a throughput measurement on the benchmark. This is a bit easier to interpret than the gross , the benchmark would otherwise produce. It tells us how much memory each allocator can allocate per unit time.We want to compare against , but just writing  will get optimized out, since the resulting pointer does not escape. Writing it to a global is sufficient to convince Go that it escapes.Here’s the results, abbreviated to show only the bytes per second. All benchmarks were performed on my AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X. Larger is better.This is quite nice, and certainly worth pursuing! The performance increase seems to scale up with the amount of memory allocated, for a 2x-4x improvement across different cases.Now we need to contend with the fact that our implementation is completely broken if we want to have pointers in it.In , when we assign a freshly-allocated chunk, we overwrite , which means the GC can reclaim it. But this is fine: as long as pointers into that arena chunk are alive, the GC will not free it, independent of the arena. So it seems like we don’t need to worry about it?However, the whole point of an arena is to allocate lots of memory that has the same lifetime. This is common for graph data structures, such as an AST or a compiler IR, which performs a lot of work that allocates a lot and then throws the result away.We are not allowed to put pointers in the arena, because they would disappear from the view of the GC and become freed too soon. But, if a pointer wants to go on an arena, it necessarily outlive the whole arena, since it outlives part of the arena, and the arena is meant to have the same lifetime.In particular, if we could make it so that holding any pointer returned by  prevents the  from being swept by the GC, the arena can safely contain pointers into itself! Consider this:We have a pointer . It is allocated on some arena .The GC sees our pointer (as a type-erased ) and marks its allocation as live.Somehow, the GC also marks  as alive as a consequence.Somehow, the GC then marks every chunk  has allocated as alive.Therefore he chunk that  points to is also alive, so  does not need to be marked directly, and will not be freed early.The step (3) is crucial. By forcing the whole arena to be marked, any pointers stored in the arena into itself will be kept alive automatically, without the GC needing to know how to scan for them.So, even though  is still going to result in a use-after-free, *New[*int](a) = New[int](a) would not! This small improvement does not make arenas themselves safe, but a data structure with an internal arena can be completely safe, so long as the only pointers that go into the arena are from the arena itself.How can we make this work? The easy part is (4), which we can implement by adding a  to the arena, and sticking every pointer we allocate into it.The cost of the  is amortized: to allocate  bytes, we wind up allocating an additional  times. But what does this do to our benchmarks?Seems pretty much the same, which is a good sign.Now that the arena does not discard any allocated memory, we can focus on condition (3): making it so that if any pointer returned by  is alive, then so is the whole arena.Here we can make use of an important property of how Go’s GC works: any pointer into an allocation will keep it alive, as well as anything reachable from that pointer. But the chunks we’re allocating are s, which will not be scanned. If there could  be a single pointer in this slice that was scanned, we would be able to stick the pointer  there, and so when anything that  returns is scanned, it would cause  to be marked as alive.So far, we have been allocating  using , but we would actually like to allocate struct { A [N]uintptr; P unsafe.Pointer }, where  is some dynamic value.In its infintie wisdom, the Go standard library actually gives us a dedicated mechanism to do this: . This can be used to construct arbitrary anonymous  types at runtime, which we can then allocate on the heap.So, instead of calling , we might call this function:This appears to have a minor but noticeable effect on performance.Looking back at , the end of this function has a branch:This is the absolute hottest part of allocation, since it is executed every time we call this function. The branch is a bit unfortunate, but it’s necessary, as noted by the comment.In C++, if we have an array of  with  elements in it, and  is a pointer to the start of the array,  is a valid pointer, even though it can’t be dereferenced; it points “one past the end” of the array. This is a useful construction, since, for example, you can use it to eliminate a loop induction variable:Go, however, gets very upset if you do this, because it confuses the garbage collector. The GC can’t tell the difference between a one-past-the-end pointer for allocation A, and for the start of allocation B immediately after it. At best this causes memory to stay alive for longer, and at worst it triggers safety interlocks in the GC. The GC will panic if it happens to scan a pointer for an address that it knows has been freed.But in our code above, every chunk now has an extra element at the very end that is not used for allocation, so we  have a pointer that  one-past-the-end of the  that we are vending memory from.The updated allocation function would look like this:Notably, we do not replace  with an end pointer, because of the  comparison. We can’t actually avoid the subtraction  because we would have to do it to make this comparison work if we got rid of .So how much better is this?Remarkably, not very! This is an improvement on the order of magnitude of one or two percentage points. This is because the branch we deleted is extremely predictable.Turns out there’s a bigger improvement we can make.Here’s the assembly Go generated for this function, heavily abridged, and annotated with the corresponding Go source code.There’s a lot going on in this function, but most of it is a mix of Go not being great at register allocation, and lots of .A write barrier is a mechanism for synchronizing ordinary user code with the GC. Go generates code for one any time a non-pointer-free type is stored. For example, writing to a , , or  requires a write barrier.Write barriers are implemented as follows: is checked, which determines whether the write barrier is necessary, which is only when the GC is in the mark phase. Otherwise the branch is taken to skip the write barrier.A call to one of the  functions happens.  is the number of pointers that the GC needs to be informed of.This function calls , which returns a buffer onto which pointers the GC needs to now trace through should be written to.The actual store happens.A write barrier is required for a case like the following. Consider the following code.This function will call  to allocate eight bytes of memory. The resulting pointer will be returned in . This function then stores  into  and returns. If we Godbolt this function, we’ll find that it does, in fact, generate a write barrier:Note that two pointers get written: the pointer returned by , and the old value of . This ensures that regardless of where in this function the GC happens to be scanning through , it sees both values during the mark phase.Now, this isn’t necessary if the relevant pointers are already reachable in some other way… which is exactly the case in our arena (thanks to the  slice). So the write barrier in the fast path is redundant.But, how do we get rid of it? There is a , but that’s not allowed outside of a list of packages allowlisted in the compiler. It also doens’t disable write barriers; it simply generates a diagnostic if any are emitted.But remember, write barriers only occur when storing pointer-typed memory… so we can just replace  with . hates this, because it doesn’t know that we’re smarter than it is. Does This make the code faster? To make it a little bit more realistic, I’ve written a separate variant of the benchmarks that hammers the GC really hard in a separate G:The result indicates that this is a worthwhile optimization for churn-heavy contexts. Performance is much worse overall, but that’s because the GC is pre-empting everyone. The improvement seems to be on the order of 20% for very small allocations.Before
After
Go does not offer an easy mechanism to “reallocate” an allocation, as with  in C. This is because it has no mechanism for freeing pointers explicitly, which is necessary for a reallocation abstraction.But we already don’t care about safety, so we can offer reallocation on our arena. Now, the reallocation we can offer is quite primitive: if a chunk happens to be the most recent one allocated, we can grow it. Otherwise we just allocate a new chunk and don’t free the old one.This makes it possible to implement “arena slices” that can be constructed by appending, which will not trigger reallocation on slice growth as long as nothing else gets put on the arena. would look something like this:Then, whenever we append to our arena slice, we can call  to grow it. However, this does not work if the slice’s base pointer is not the original address returned by  or . It is an exercise for the reader to:Implement a  type that uses an arena for allocation.Make this work for any value of  within the most recent allocation, not just the base offset. This requires extra book-keeping.Here is the entirety of the code that we have developed, not including the reallocation function above.There are other optimizations that we could make here that I haven’t discussed. For example, arenas could be re-used; once an arena is done, it could be “reset” and placed into a . This arena would not need to go into the GC to request new chunks, re-using the ones previously allocated (and potentially saving on the cost of zeroing memory over and over again).I did say that this relies very heavily on Go’s internal implementation details. Whats the odds that they get broken in the future? Well, the requirement that allocations know their shape is forced by the existence of , and the requirement that a pointer into any part of an allocation keeps the whole thing alive essentially comes from slices being both sliceable and mutable; once a slice escapes to the heap (and thus multiple goroutines) coordinating copies for shrinking a slice would require much more complexity than the current write barrier implementation.And in my opinion, it’s pretty safe to say that Hyrum’s Law has us covered here. ;)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Best AI Models For Invoice Processing: Benchmark Comparisons</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-best-ai-models-for-invoice-processing-benchmark-comparisons?source=rss</link><author>Oleg Kokorin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:45:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve tested the 7 most popular AI models to see how well they process invoices out-of-the-box, without any fine-tuning.Which model outperforms all others by Why Google AI fails to work with structured dataSee which models handle low-resolution scans the bestTo meet the goal of this test, I set out on a search for AI models using these criteria:: Popular models have better support and documentation.Invoice Processing Capability: The model needs to be able to process invoices from the get-go, without fine-tuning or training the API.: As the results of this test are meant to be used in practice, it’s important for each model to have API integration capabilities for easy integration.I’ve landed on 7 AI models outlined below. I’ve given each one a nickname for convenience:Amazon Analyze Expense API, or “”Azure AI Document Intelligence - Invoice Prebuilt Model, or “”Google Document AI - Invoice Parser, or “”GPT-4o API - text input with 3rd party OCR, or “”GPT-4o API - image input, or “”Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, or “”Deepseek v3 - text input, or “”The models were tested on a dataset of 20 invoices of various layouts and years of issue (from 2006 to 2020).| Invoice Year | Number of Invoices |
|----|----|
| 2006 — 2010 | 6 |
| 2011 — 2015 | 4 |
| 2016 — 2020 | 10 |Analyzing each invoice, I’ve determined a list of 16 key fields that are common among all invoices and contain the most important data:\
Invoice Id, Invoice Date, Net Amount, Tax Amount, Total Amount, Due Date, Purchase Order, Payment Terms, Customer Address, Customer Name, Vendor Address, Vendor Name, Item: Description, Item: Quantity, Item: Unit Price, Item: Amount.\
Fields extracted by the models were mapped to a common naming convention to ensure consistency. LLM models (GPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini) were specifically asked to return the results using these common field names.For each invoice, I’ve evaluated how well the models extracted key items’ fields:\
Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Total PriceI’ve used a weighted efficiency metric (Eff, %) to assess the accuracy of extraction. This metric combines:\
Strict Essential Fields: Exact matches, like invoice ID, dates, etc.\
Non-Strict Essential Fields: Partial matches allowed if similarity (RLD, %) exceeds a threshold.\
Invoice Items: Evaluated as correct only if all item attributes are extracted accurately.==Overall Efficiency (Eff, %): Eff, % = (COUNTIF(strict ess. fields, positive) + COUNTIF(non-strict ess. fields, positive if RLD > RLD threshold) + COUNTIF(items, positive)) / ((COUNT(all fields) + COUNT(all items)) * 100==\
==Item-Level Efficiency (Eff-I, %): Eff-I, % = Positive IF (ALL(Quantity, Unit Price, Amount - positive) AND RLD(Description) > RLD threshold) * 100==Invoice Recognition Results\
: Google’s results are omitted from this as Google failed to extract items properly.Azure isn’t the best with item descriptions.One of the invoices in the dataset contains employee names as items. In this invoice, Azure failed to detect the full item names, recognizing only the first names, whereas other models successfully identified the complete names in all 12 items.\
This issue significantly impacted Azure’s efficiency on this invoice, which was notably lower (33.3%) compared to the other models.\
💡 Azure’s inability to parse multi-word descriptions in structured fields highlights a critical limitation compared to competitors.Low resolution of invoices practically does not affect the quality of detection.Low resolution (as perceived by the human eye) of invoices generally did not degrade detection quality. The low resolution mainly results in minor recognition mistakes, for example, in one of the invoices, Deepseek mistook a comma for a dot, leading to an incorrect numerical value.\
💡 Modern OCR and AI models are robust to resolution issues, though rare formatting errors may occur.Google fails at detecting items.Google combines all item fields into a single string, which makes it impossible to compare the results to other models. Google recognition results:\
All other services have 100% correct detection with breakdown by attributes.\
💡 Google’s AI is not capable of extracting structured data without fine-tuning.Multi-line item descriptions did not affect the quality of detection.💡 Except for Google AI’s case above, multi-line item descriptions did not negatively impact detection quality across all models.Gemini has the best “attention to detail.”LLMs like GPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek can be asked to extract more data than pre-built invoice recognition models. Among all LLMs, Gemini has the best accuracy when it comes to extracting additional data from invoice items. GPT often extracted correct fields but incorrect field values, and DeepSeek performed the worst out of the 3 models with the poorest field value extraction accuracy.\
💡 Gemini has the highest items extraction accuracy compared to other LLMs: it extracts all fields, not just the standard ones, and has the highest accuracy in preserving text and numerical values.I’ve calculated the cost of processing 1000 invoices by each model, as well as the average cost of processing one invoice:| Service | Cost | Cost per page (average) |
|----|----|----|
|  | $10 / 1000 pages (1) | $0.01 |
|  | $10 / 1000 pages | $0.01 |
|  | $10 / 1000 pages | $0.01 |

Co-founder Michael Truell apologized for the issue, clarified that no such policy exists, and attributed the mishap to AI hallucination and a session management bug. The Register reports: Users of the Cursor editor, designed to generate and fix source code in response to user prompts, have sometimes been booted from the software when trying to use the app in multiple sessions on different machines. Some folks who inquired about the inability to maintain multiple logins for the subscription service across different machines received a reply from the company's support email indicating this was expected behavior. But the person on the other end of that email wasn't a person at all, but an AI support bot. And it evidently made that policy up.
 
In an effort to placate annoyed users this week, Michael Truell co-founder of Cursor creator Anysphere, published a note to Reddit to apologize for the snafu. "Hey! We have no such policy," he wrote. "You're of course free to use Cursor on multiple machines. Unfortunately, this is an incorrect response from a front-line AI support bot. We did roll out a change to improve the security of sessions, and we're investigating to see if it caused any problems with session invalidation." Truell added that Cursor provides an interface for viewing active sessions in its settings and apologized for the confusion.
 
In a post to the Hacker News discussion of the SNAFU, Truell again apologized and acknowledged that something had gone wrong. "We've already begun investigating, and some very early results: Any AI responses used for email support are now clearly labeled as such. We use AI-assisted responses as the first filter for email support." He said the developer who raised this issue had been refunded. The session logout issue, now fixed, appears to have been the result of a race condition that arises on slow connections and spawns unwanted sessions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thoughts on Upwind alternative to Wiz?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1k4p81b/thoughts_on_upwind_alternative_to_wiz/</link><author>/u/pxrage</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:29:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm contracting as a fCTO for enterprise health tech, wrapping up a project focused on optimizing their k8s monitoring costs. We are nearly done implementing and rolling out a new eBPF based solution to further cut cost.In the same time I'm tackling their security tooling related costs. They're currently heavily invested in AWS-native tools, and we're exploring alternatives that might offer better value. Potentially integrating more smoothly with our BYOC infra.I've already begun PoV using Upwind. Finished initial deep dive exploring their run-time powered cloud security stack and seems like it's the right fit for us. While not completely validated, I am impressed by the claim of reducing noise by up to 95% and the speed improvement up root cause analysis (via client case studies). Their use of eBPF for agentless sensors also resonates with our goal of maintaining efficiency.Before we dive deeper, I wanted to tap into the community's collective wisdom:"Runtime-powered" reality check: For those who have experience, how well does the "runtime-powered" aspect deliver in practice? Does it truly leverage runtime context effectively to prioritize real threats and reduce alert fatigue compared to more traditional CNAPP solutions or native cloud provider tools? How seamless is the integration of its CSPM, CWPP, Vulnerability Management, etc., under this runtime umbrella?eBPF monitoring and security in one: we've already invested in building out an eBPF-based o11y stack. Has anyone successfully leveraged eBPF for both monitoring/observability and security within the same k8s environment? Are there tangible synergies (performance benefits, reduced overhead, unified data plane) or is it more practical to keep these stacks separate, even if both utilize eBPF? Does using eBPF security stack alongside an existing eBPF monitoring solution create conflicts or complexities?Lastly, we're still early in the discovery phase that I'm allowed to look beyond one single security provider. Are there other runtime-focused security platforms (especially those leveraging eBPF) that you've found particularly effective in complex K8s environments, specifically when cost optimization and reducing tool sprawl are key drivers?Appreciate any insights, thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Detained Venezuelan migrants make urgent plea against deportation | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT6dsPNvy5A</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YT6dsPNvy5A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:18:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Venezuelan migrants detained at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Texas made desperate pleas for due process to avoid deportation from the United States.

In a televised address, Saab claimed the Salvadorian’s “cynical” offer exposed him as a narcissistic “neo-Nazi” who had “kidnapped” more than 250 Venezuelan migrants sent to a maximum-security jail in El Salvador by the Trump administration since mid-March.“Bukele is a serial human rights violator,” Saab said, pointing to the politician’s “horrifying” three-year anti-gang crackdown, which has seen at least 85,000 Salvadorians thrown in jail, largely without due process. Human rights activists say more than 360 prisoners have died.Some members of Venezuela’s opposition – reeling from its failure to dislodge Maduro, despite seemingly beating him in last July’s presidential election – welcomed Bukele’s offer. Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader who lives in Spain, said the idea had his “full support”. The opposition’s most important leader, María Corina Machado, made no immediate comment.However, many political and human rights activists have voiced perplexity and shock that the Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador – having been denied due process in the US and deported to an authoritarian foreign land – had become embroiled in the political tussle between strongman populists such as Trump, Bukele and Maduro.“The idea that there would be a [prisoner] trade should be loathsome to anyone who actually cares about human rights,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, suspected the plight of the Venezuelans being held in El Salvador and Bukele’s prisoner swap “PR stunt” had potential benefits for both Bukele and Maduro.“Maduro’s quite happy to feud with Bukele and point to human rights abuses in El Salvador as a way of distracting from the brutal repression and violence of his own regime,” Ramsey said. According to the human rights group Foro Penal, Maduro’s jails currently house about 900 political prisoners. Thousands were imprisoned after last year’s election when Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, ordered a crackdown to stop his apparent victor, Edmundo González, from taking power.From Bukele’s perspective, offer was “a smart way of shifting the conversation away from concerns around the deportees being held in El Salvador back to the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela”, Ramsay said.For the migrants caught up in the geopolitical jailings, the consequences are calamitous. Many have not been convicted of any crime and it is unclear how long they will be held.In an interview last week, the wife of one Venezuelan prisoner, a singer called Arturo Suárez Trejo, lamented how the Venezuelan detainees seemed to have become part of a high-stakes game of chess. “And they are the pawns,” said Nathali Sánchez, rejecting claims that the father of her child was involved in crime. “It’s evil,” she added.The Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan migrants – who it has accused, largely without evidence, of being gang members and terrorists – has put Venezuela’s opposition in a difficult spot.Seemingly fearful of alienating Trump’s administration, its key leaders – including including Machado – have said little about the migration crackdown or the deportation of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador. “[The opposition has] largely held its tongue on issues of the treatment of fellow citizens because of its larger goal of gaining the White House’s support for its preferred strategy [to defeat Maduro] and that also is reprehensible,” Sabatini said.Among the friends and families of the incarcerated migrants – many of them opposition supporters who fled Venezuela to escape Maduro’s regime – the opposition’s failure to defend them is causing anger and frustration.“The reality is that the Venezuelan opposition needs to have a good relationship with the White House, and they understand that they can’t be perceived as criticizing Trump,” said Ramsey. “But on the other hand, the general public in Venezuela is outraged at the situation faced by those who’ve been deported and sent to this maximum security jail in El Salvador. So it really puts the opposition in between a rock and a hard place.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Visiting Us</title><link>https://www.epic.com/visiting/</link><author>tobr</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:49:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sat, Apr 26—Fri, May 09, 2025Fri, May 16—Sun, May 18, 2025Sat, Aug 09—Fri, Aug 22, 2025Wed, Dec 24—Thu, Dec 25, 2025]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supercharge Your Go Tests Using Fake HTTP Services</title><link>https://tutorialedge.net/golang/testing-with-fake-http-services-in-go/</link><author>/u/elliotforbes</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:48:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why Testing With Fakes Is ImportantTesting is a critical part of building reliable and maintainable Go applications. When your code interacts with external HTTP services, relying on real HTTP requests during tests can lead to flaky and inconsistent results. Network issues, rate limits, or changes in external APIs can all cause your tests to fail unpredictably. By using fake HTTP services, you can simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment, ensuring your tests are fast, reliable, and repeatable. In this article, we’ll explore how to set up fake HTTP services in Go to improve the confidence you have in your systems and streamline your testing process.Configurable HTTP Clients with Environment VariablesIn order for this approach to work however, you do need to ensure that you build your systems in such a way that it’s easy to specify where the clients are ultimately sending your HTTP requests to. One effective approach is to use environment variables to configure the base URLs your clients interact with. This ensures that your application can seamlessly switch between production, staging, and testing environments without requiring code changes.Another approach is to have a sensible default base URL specified as a constant within the client code. You could then leverage something like the 
  functional options parameter pattern to allow for the overriding of this value.The important thing is that you have some level of control over this value within your client. This allows you to leverage the concept of fakes far easier in your test fixtures.Here’s an example of how you can achieve this:Benefits of This ApproachEnvironment-Specific Configuration: By using environment variables, you can easily configure your application to use different base URLs for production, staging, or local testing environments.: During testing, you can set the  to point to a fake HTTP service or mock server, allowing you to simulate various scenarios without relying on external services.: Sensitive URLs or credentials can be managed securely using environment variables, reducing the risk of hardcoding them into your source code.When writing tests, you can override the  environment variable to point to your fake HTTP service:By designing your HTTP clients with configurability in mind, you can ensure that your application is both flexible and testable, leading to more robust and maintainable code.Writing HTTP Tests Using Now, traditionally, a Go developer would lean on the 
  net/http/httptest package for creating and managing test HTTP servers. These servers allow you to simulate HTTP responses and test how your application interacts with external services in a controlled environment.Example: How to test Go Clients with httptestSuppose you have an HTTP client that fetches data from an external API. You can use  to simulate the API’s behavior and test your client’s functionality.Whilst this approach works, I think it could be improved upon to provide a better experience for developers maintaining and extending these tests.Over the past year, I’ve been working through improving the developer experience of writing a suite of fairly comprehensive and complex acceptance tests that exercise the integrations.From my totally un-biased perspective, this strikes me as a far easier setup of a fake that allows me to really focus my attention on the logic contained within my clients as opposed to worry too much about the fake setup itself.Let’s throw this into our earlier example to see how this plays out:This sets up a series of sensible defaults that you’d typically expect of an API, like setting the  to . It also does some basic assertions that these endpoints defined on the fake have actually been called at least once.For those of you that require a stronger suite of assertions on both how your client methods handle the responses, as well as guaranteeing that you’ve sent the correct request shape to the downstream API. You can take advantage of the  field when registering an  struct on the downstream API.As a general rule, I’d highly recommend fleshing out assertions that validate you are indeed sending the right shape of data that a downstream API expects. Perhaps validating the headers being sent with the request may be a good idea.Simulating Errors in your FakesIt’d be lovely if we only ever had to worry about happy-path testing and could disregard any potential error cases or sad paths. Our software systems would be much simpler and take far less time to build. However, as we live in the real world, we know that this isn’t the case and our jobs as engineers is to ensure we’re able to handle the inevitable failures.It’s important that regardless of what testing approach you leverage, you should be writing tests that ensure you are indeed exercising these sad-path cases.The fakes package enables us to simulate failure cases within our tests with ease:Now, when our test goes to hit our downstream API, it’ll be greeted with a lovely 404 status code and an error message that will allow us to exercise our code’s ability to handle failure gracefully.In this article, we’ve explored how to set up tests for Go applications using fake HTTP services, leveraging both the  package and the  library. By adopting these techniques, you can create robust, reliable, and maintainable tests that simulate real-world scenarios while avoiding the pitfalls of flaky external dependencies.The  library, in particular, aims to simplify the process of creating and managing fake HTTP services, providing a more developer-friendly experience. Whether you’re testing happy paths or simulating error cases, this library can help streamline your testing workflow and improve the overall quality of your codebase.If you found this article helpful or have feedback on the  library, I’d love to hear from you!

As one of the most useful and well-regarded tools in a Mac gamer's toolkit, it could be seen as a great loss, but its developer hopes you'll move on with what he considers a better option: supporting CodeWeavers' CrossOver product.
 
Also, Whisky's creator is an 18-year-old college student, and he could use a break. "I am 18, yes, and attending Northeastern University, so it's always a balancing act between my school work and dev work," Isaac Marovitz wrote to Ars. The Whisky project has "been more or less in this state for a few months, I posted the notice mostly to clarify and formally announce it," Marovitz said, having received "a lot of questions" about the project status. [...] "Whisky, in my opinion, has not been a positive on the Wine community as a whole," Marovitz wrote on the Whisky site.
 
He advised that Whisky users buy a CrossOver license, and noted that while CodeWeavers and Valve's work on Proton have had a big impact on the Wine project, "the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is practically zero." Fixes for Wine running Mac games "have to come from people who are not only incredibly knowledgeable on C, Wine, Windows, but also macOS," Marovitz wrote, and "the pool of developers with those skills is very limited." While Marovitz told Ars that he's had "some contact with CodeWeavers" in making Whisky, "they were always curious and never told me what I should or should not do." It became clear to him, though, "from what [CodeWeavers] could tell me as well as observing the attitude of the wider community that Whisky could seriously threaten CrossOver's viability." "Whisky may have been a CrossOver competitor, but that's not how we feel today," wrote CodeWeavers CEO James B. Ramey in a statement. "Our response is simply one of empathy, understanding, and acknowledgement for Isaac's situation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis death: Reactions from Vatican, US, and Rome | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85XIGHE07SY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/85XIGHE07SY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:03:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World leaders have been mourning the death of Pope Francis.

These initiatives, including the Digital Bangladesh program (ICT Policy 2009), Smart Bangladesh (ICT Master Plan 2041), and National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2024, focus on harnessing the global digital revolution to kickstart technological innovation and digital transformation in Bangladesh.\
However, the core of Bangladesh’s efforts to shape its digital future relies primarily on Bangladesh’s ability to truly harness its renewable energy sector. Despite its ambitious plans, power problems continue to plague Bangladesh, especially in the country’s growth-stage , where demand for energy far outpaces supply. In fact, Bangladesh experienced power outages for over 30% of all of 2022, highlighting the desperate need for Bangladesh to grow its energy supply.As Bangladesh moves toward a more digitally-driven economy, addressing its energy challenges becomes critical, not only for ensuring infrastructure sovereignty, but also for safeguarding its digital sovereignty.Renewable energy investmentBangladesh has one of the highest rates of power demand growth globally, resulting in a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, with  of its power generation coming from natural gas, while coal usage continues to increase as a source of electricity. Additionally, Bangladesh’s usage of coal will most likely increase as coal prices continue to fall due to reduced demand, increased coal supply, and shifts among developed nations to renewable energy, among a variety of other factors. As a result, Bangladesh needs to grow its renewable energy industry to plan for less dependency on harmful energy sources like natural gas and coal.\
Bangladesh’s efforts to grow its renewable energy sector have resulted in a significant need for foreign direct investment in its energy sector. China has played a  in Bangladesh-specific investments in renewable energy, with a focus on solar energy.  saw the announcement of a 100MW solar plant to be built by a joint venture between China's CREC International Renewable Energy Company and Bangladesh's state-owned B-R Powergen Limited (BRPL). Around the same time, a venture led by the Chinese firm Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company (BCRECL) resulted in the commissioning of the 68MW Sirajganj Solar Park. Additionally, China’s Huadian Corporation signed an agreement in mid-2024 to develop a solar facility with projected power production of 160MW.\
 also saw the beginning of operations for the 60MW Cox’s Bazar wind plant, noted as “the first centralized wind power project in Bangladesh invested and constructed by Chinese enterprises.” The BCRECL has also taken efforts to establish a 50MW wind power plant in Payra.\
Chinese investment in Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector continues to build, with notable Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi announcing its interest in Bangladesh-specific investments in March 2025. This visit built on a previous visit in late 2024 featuring LONGi and Tongwei Co., Ltd., another Chinese-based solar manufacturer, with both these trade delegations highlighting the increasing interest for Chinese firms and investors in controlling Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector.Investments in physical infrastructureChina’s involvement in Bangladesh extends beyond renewable energy, with China being a major player in financing and constructing critical infrastructure in Bangladesh, including ports, bridges, and power plants. As of mid-2024, China accounted for 27 power projects in Bangladesh, with the coal-fired Payra power plant, generating an impressive 1,320 MW of power, being built as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\
China has played a large role in developing and constructing crucial infrastructure in Bangladesh, ranging from ports to special economic zones (SEZs). Bangladesh’s Mongla port, its second largest port, received a loan of $400 million for modernization efforts on . Bangladesh’s largest port, Chittagong port, alongside the Payra port, both of significant strategic importance in the Indian Ocean, were both constructed by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), building on China’s strategy of establishing a crucial presence at strategic maritime centers throughout the globe. Additionally, the planned Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone,  as the “first industrial zone in Bangladesh invested, developed, and operated by a Chinese company,” has gained immense investment traction and acceleration in recent months, particularly given a bilateral meeting between leaders Muhammad Yunis and Xi Jinping in Beijing on March 28, 2025.\
China has also been a major source of financing, construction, and technical assistance in terms of bridge infrastructure in Bangladesh. The Padma bridge, a 6.15km bridge built at a cost of nearly $4 billion, was constructed by Chinese SOE China Major Bridge Engineering Company. As of , China was building over 20 bridges in Bangladesh, with over 650 companies investing into the country during the same period, with Chinese loans totalling just over $2.33 billion this time.Need for digital infrastructure sovereigntyAssuming Bangladesh can resolve its domestic power generation issues with clean energy controlled by Bangladesh interests, it must also take its digital infrastructure sovereignty into consideration as Bangladesh develops its digital economy.\
In the same vein, Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure is already seeing growing dependencies on Chinese firms and investment. In December 2024, Huawei announced efforts to bolster Bangladesh’s digital infrastructure development, notably co-launching an innovation lab with the Bangladesh government and establishing a China-Bangladesh fintech exchange program. Mid-2024 also saw Bangladesh’s former Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu lauding China’s technology innovation in telecommunications, e-commerce, green energy, and agriculture, and much more.\
These efforts build on Huawei’s , alongside other Chinese technology giants like ZTE, in growing Bangladesh's digital industry, with key  including 5G, enterprise cloud solutions, and much more. The Chinese government has also played a large role in advancing Bangladesh's technology development, completing a joint project in late 2022 to connect 2,600 government offices in a move to solidify national connectivity.In conclusion, Bangladesh's pursuit of a digital economy hinges on its ability to address critical challenges in energy infrastructure, with a focus on developing its renewable energy sources. With power shortages continuing to hinder growth, investing in clean sustainable energy is paramount for the nation’s digital transformation.\
While Chinese investments in energy, infrastructure, and digital technology have accelerated progress, they also highlight the need for Bangladesh to carefully manage its long-term energy and digital sovereignty.\n If it is able to secure a sustainable energy future, Bangladesh can effectively harness its full potential to develop its digital economy while maintaining its digital infrastructure sovereignty, enabling it to emerge as a competitive player in the global digital economy.\

Both sides have accused each other of breaching the truce. 
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow will now assess the truce before considering further moves. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the ceasefire "empty" and a "PR exercise". He's pushing for a 30-day pause in strikes on civilian targets. Talks aimed at reaching a longer ceasefire are due to be held in London this week.

Plus, in his final Easter message yesterday, Pope Francis called for peace in Ukraine. Today, the presidents of Ukraine and Russia have expressed their condolences following the Pope's death. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Pope Francis “prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support.”  

Meanwhile, Russia’s Vladimir Putin has said Francis "actively promoted the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive cooperation between Russia and the Holy See."

However, a macroeconomic environment that’s punctuated by aggressive trading sanctions may be an opportunity for AI models to show their value.\
According to Franklin Templeton, equity securities are  with their prices prone to fluctuations and the loss of principle. In particular, small and mid-cap stocks can struggle amid greater risks and volatility compared to larger capitalization stocks.\
Likewise, fixed-income securities can be affected by uncertainty among interest rates, credit, inflation, reinvestment risks, and the possible loss of capital. Because tariffs are inflationary by nature, combative interest rate hikes by the Fed can prompt the value of fixed-income securities to fall.\
JP Morgan data states that US trade policy uncertainty has , far surpassing the volatility experienced at any other stage in the past 40 years.\
The investment bank suggests that policy documents, executive orders, and public statements by the Trump administration point to a significant change in America’s trading relationship on the world stage.\
For hedge funds, market uncertainty can be an opportunity in the pursuit of alpha. However, clouded outlooks call for a more robust approach to identifying opportunities and capitalizing on them faster than their competitors.\
With the news that Minotaur Global Opportunities Fund, consisting of a fully AI-powered portfolio, achieved a  in its first six months to January 2025, doubling the performance of its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index in the process, artificial intelligence could be a key solution to navigating a prospective trade war for hedge funds.How do Trade Wars Impact Markets?We can look to history to better understand the impact of the Trump administration’s use of tariffs on markets.\
During the tariff wars that were initiated during Trump’s first term, US equities markets saw greater levels of volatility as performance was dictated by news on trade talks and the future of the tariffs in place. This, , led to more investors embracing ‘safe haven’ assets on a global scale.\
In instances where tariff talks broke down or additional trade tariffs were applied, US stocks experienced sell-offs. On the other hand, when optimism surrounding trade deals improved, stocks generally rose.\
When the Phase I trade deal was announced in October 2019, stocks rallied. While tariffs contributed to a 4.38% contraction in the S&P 500 in 2018, the clearing outlook led to 31.49% gains in 2019. Similar patterns could be found in the China A Index over the same period.\
What does this mean for Wall Street during Trump’s second term? Given that the President is seeking to implement a protectionist approach to the US economy, we can expect the volatility experienced in 2018 and 2019 to be more pronounced should tariffs continue to be used as a bargaining chip on the world stage.\
For hedge funds seeking to outmaneuver markets to take advantage of the volatility of trade wars, it’s worth looking at how AI can help leverage more decisive, data-driven actions.Minotaur Capital, which is an investment firm based in Sydney, Australia, has sought to cut costs using artificial intelligence, with founder Armina Rosenberg suggesting that it’s around ‘half the price’ to operate in terms of cost versus a junior analyst salary.\
Crucially, its large language model (LLM) framework consumes  daily and can deliver 2,000-word reports on just about any global stock that it believes has the potential to double its value in three years or tenfold over the next decade.\
Given the chaotic nature of trade wars, this ability to consume breaking news at scale and use it to deliver comprehensive reports means that AI can help hedge funds navigate uncertainty far more efficiently than human analysts. This can be a particular advantage at a time when  differently to emerging news on a daily basis.\
While Minotaur is a use case where AI appears to be outperforming benchmarks in a fully autonomous environment, Liming Zhu, a professor at the University of New South Wales, believes that the best outcomes for the technology come from environments with bottom-up experimentation and deep human expertise. \
This calls for prime services for hedge funds that can tailor products to the individual needs of hedge funds that can turn to embedded AI to improve their actionable market insights.\
This means that firms can interpret forecasts as probabilistic, and make measured risks based on educated judgment calls from structured and unstructured data.Fundamentally, the incorporation of AI and its measured outcomes helps hedge funds to act with agility in the face of market uncertainty.\
Although trade wars can cloud the macroeconomic outlook for US equities and investment opportunities throughout the rest of the world, artificial intelligence tools can turn risky market conditions into an opportunity to make moves that other institutions have failed to identify, opening the door to alpha even as investor sentiment struggles for momentum.\
The artificial intelligence boom has been rapidly building momentum on Wall Street, and for its hedge fund adopters, a prospective global trade war could be an opportunity to test its capabilities. As Minotaur has shown over the past six months, the reward for the most sophisticated AI model could be seismic.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Helpful to Harmful: How AI Recommendations Destroyed My OS</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/from-helpful-to-harmful-how-ai-recommendations-destroyed-my-os?source=rss</link><author>Maximiliano Contieri</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:02:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why you should always be in controlTL;DR: Always stay in control when using AI tools. Blind trust can lead you to costly mistakes.I write multiple articles each week and wanted to automate the repetitive parts of my process.This week, an internal memo by Shopify's CEO, Tobias Lutke, went viral.TL;DR: The memo requires Shopify's workers to be proficient in AI tools.AI Proficiency Is Now MandatoryUsing AI effectively is no longer optional at Shopify; it is a baseline expectation for all employees, regardless of role. This marks a significant cultural and operational shift.Non-Use of AI Requires JustificationEmployees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources (e.g., more staff or time). Stagnation is framed as failure, and employees are encouraged to upskill and experiment with AI continuously.AI in Product DevelopmentAI must be integrated into the early stages (prototype phase) of all GSD (get shit done) projects. This approach is intended to dramatically accelerate learning, iteration, and team collaboration.Performance AccountabilityShopify is adding AI usage to its performance and peer review criteria, making AI adoption part of how employees are evaluated and rewarded, including leadership and executive teams.I do not work at Shopify, and I am not affiliated with the company.I take AI tools as helpers and a mandatory tool both as a software developer and a writer, and I heavily rely on them.I am also an advocate of professional Vibe Coding.In every conference, article, and paper I write, I encourage humans to embrace the AI tools and use them heavily (with caution).I have two quotes (not mine):You must always be in control.AI won't take your job, but a human using it will certainly do; you should become that person.(You can see this at 53:40 of this conference)This week, I needed to make some local tests using Python.I write articles in 25+ different programming languages and don't have all of them installed locally.Sometimes I use virtual machines, codelabs and repl.it running on websites.This time, I needed to quickly install Python locally (an accidental task).It started with a simple idea: automate a few things. Save time. Be smart.So I did what many people are doing now.AI answered fast. Confident. Like it had done a thousand times before.Spoiler: I blindly trusted it. One command later, my operating system was toast.In my code smell articles, I use the 10 most popular AI programming tools.I just opened one of them (ChatGPT) and prompted it to give me some commands to install Python on my Ubuntu.Give me a command to install Python in UbuntuUntil last week, I used to write:hello, please give me a command to install Python in UbuntuBut now I am aware that those extra tokens consume lots of resources (water, for example), and I am not polite to machines anymore. 😢🤖The answer was short and clear:sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -yI didn't bother to read it.I've been using Linux for more than 20 years now.I just pasted the answer. Typed my password mechanically (I was using sudo to install pip), and went to make dinner.When I came back, the terminal showed a very long list of commands. That was strange. I just wanted to install Python (with pip, which is the package manager).The problem (as you might have discovered by now) was this innocent line:Which upgraded (and bricked) my personal computer.ChatGPT decided it was a very good decision to upgrade the operating system first.I agree that keeping an updated operating system is a good decision to have the latest protections, but this is something you need to plan, have a good backup, and not something you do casually.The system was bricked, and so was I.A careful look to the command (and a question to other IAs) will give a more accurate (and safer) answer:I had a very long experience with Ubuntu. I was perfectly capable of reading a forum or googling (who googles anything today, BTW?).I am also a preacher on not to trust AIs blindly, and I enforce it on  I write.This should not happen to someone like me.Our brain is a master of efficiency.Every decision we make consumes energy, so the oldest part of our brain, the so-called "reptilian brain", evolved to optimize for survival, not for deep thinking.It wants quick reactions, minimal effort, and zero sugar waste.That’s why it loves delegation.But what happens when the thing you’re delegating to is a machine?You do it every day: you follow GPS instructions without questioning them, rely on autocomplete to finish your thoughts, and let a recommendation engine tell you what to watch, buy, or read.On the surface, this looks like convenience.Underneath, it’s a biological shortcut.Your brain’s decision-making resources are limited. To avoid fatigue, it offloads choices wherever possible.This isn’t always bad. Routines and heuristics allow you to function in a complex world without becoming overwhelmed.But when this primitive reflex takes control, you stop asking “why?” — and that’s when things get risky.One of the most dangerous aspects of AI delegation is the illusion of competence. A machine that speaks eloquently, formats correctly, or generates working code appears smart. Sometimes smarter than you.But behind the polish may lie shallow reasoning, misinterpretation, or even hallucinated content.You don’t notice because your cognitive laziness kicks in.You assume correctness because it "sounds right." The deeper, analytical part of your brain — your prefrontal cortex — never gets involved.This is exactly how misinformation spreads. It’s also how bugs get deployed, contracts go wrong, and systems fail.The human cost of faulty AI decisions is already here: people getting denied healthcare coverage, flagged as fraudulent, or jailed based on algorithmic predictions. In these cases, the true danger isn’t just the AI — it’s the uncritical acceptance of its output.When you delegate a decision to a system you don’t understand and don’t check, you’ve surrendered agency. Worse: you’ve surrendered accountability."The algorithm said so" becomes a shield. But it shouldn’t be.Delegation isn’t inherently bad. But you have to make it conscious. That means:Verifying the output of any AI you use, especially for critical tasksUnderstanding the limits of the system you’re relying onTaking back responsibility for decisions, even when tools make them easierAm I outsourcing this because it’s efficient — or because I’m lazy?”That question alone can re-engage your rational brain.Your brain wants to survive.It doesn’t care if your software works, your model is fair, or your report is accurate.It just wants to offload effort.That worked fine in the jungle.But not in a world where decisions have digital consequences.Delegation without scrutiny is not efficiency. It’s abdication.And if you don’t remain in control of your decisions, someone—or something-else will.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A M.2 HDMI capture card</title><link>https://interfacinglinux.com/2025/04/18/magewell-eco-m-2-hdmi-capture-card/</link><author>Venn1</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:01:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WW2 Deadliest Mission: Arctic Convoys</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F9fxDWl6GQ</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_F9fxDWl6GQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Download World of Warships: Legends today: https://wowsl.co/42lO4O9

In August 1941, the Allies launched Operation Dervish. This was the first of the Arctic Convoys, ships which sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland and North America, and brought essential supplies to the Soviet Union.

After the successful launch of Operation Barbarossa, the USSR was in desperate need of raw materials, fuel, military equipment and food. Realising the importance of keeping the Germans fighting on two fronts, Churchill offered a helping hand to Stalin.

Though eager to cooperate, the task of shipping supplies to the Soviet ports of Murmansk and Archangel was not an easy task. Sailing up through the treacherous Northern Atlantic, the convoys were faced with some of the harshest seafaring conditions, including temperatures that reached -30 degrees Celsius, gale force 10 winds, towering seas, intense fog and drift ice. The sailors on deck also had to be wary of the continuous threat of icebergs.

If this wasn’t enough of a challenge to the 78 convoys that made the journey to the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945, the merchant vessels also faced the serious possibility of U-Boat attacks or German bombing raids.

As the convoys skirted occupied Norway en route to Murmansk and Archangel, the close proximity of German air and naval bases meant that attacks on the convoys were commonplace, and casualties were inevitable. Over 3,000 men lost their lives on the Arctic Convoys with 87 merchant ships and 18 Royal Navy ships lost.

In this documentary, Dan Snow delves deep into the history of the Arctic Convoys and reveals the ultimate sacrifice of the crews onboard the ships that made the perilous journey.

This page was served to you by a real Nintendo Wii.For a long time, I’ve enjoyed the idea of running general-purpose operating systems on decidedly not-general-purpose hardware.There’s been a few good examples of this over the years, including a few which were officially sanctioned by the OEM. Back in the day, my PS3 ran Yellow Dog Linux, and I’ve been searching for a (decently priced) copy of PS2 Linux for 10+ years at this point.But what a lot of these systems have in common is that they’re now very outdated. Or they’re hobbyist ports that someone got running once and where longer-term support never made it upstream. The PSP Linux kernel image was last built in 2008, and Dreamcast Linux is even more retro, using a 2.4.5 kernel built in 2001.I haven’t seen many of these projects where I’d be comfortable running one as part of an actual production workload. Until now.While browsing the NetBSD website recently, I noticed the fact that there was a ‘Wii’ option listed right there on the front page in the ‘Install Media’ section, nestled right next to the other first-class targets like the Raspberry Pi, and generic x86 machines.Unlike the other outdated and unmaintained examples above, clicking through to the NetBSD Wii port takes you to the latest stable NetBSD 10.1 release from Dec 2024. Even the daily HEAD builds are composed for the Wii.As soon as I discovered this was fully supported and maintained, I knew I had to try deploying an actual production workload on it. That workload is the blog you’re reading now.Finding a sacrificial WiiOur story begins at the EMF Camp 2024 Swap Shop - your premier source for pre-loved game consoles, cardboard boxes full of 56k modems, and radioactive orphan sources.I picked this up expecting to use it for homebrew games and emulation mostly, but I don’t think it expected this fate.So we have a spare Wii. And an OS with mainline support. But is a Wii actually fast enough to handle this as a production workload?The single-core ‘Broadway’ CPU in the Wii is part of IBM’s continued evolution of the PowerPC 750 lineup, dating all the way back to Apple’s iconic 1998 Bondi Blue fishtank iMac. Although Broadway is one of the later 750 revisions, the commercially-available equivalent chip - the PowerPC 750CL - has a maximum TDP of only 9.8 W, and clocks about 33% higher than the version in the Wii.So with a single-core chip based on a late-90s architecture and a TDP well under 10 W, it’s clear that we’re probably fairly contstrained here in terms of compute performance.With that said, one of the other PowerPC 750 deployments you might be familiar with is currently floating 1,500,000 km from Earth mapping the deepest reaches of the universe in more detail than humanity has ever seen before. So if I can’t get this thing serving a static website, then I think it’s probably time to execute on my long-term plan of retiring from tech and opening a cat cafe.On a more serious note, you can read about the James Wii Space Telescope’s use of the PowerPC 750 in this NASA presentation. The 750 actually gets a lot of use in spaceflight and satellite applications because there is a radiation-hardened version available, known as the RAD750. Some other recent uses of the chip include both the Mars Curiosity and Perseverance rovers.Installing NetBSD on the WiiOkay, Nintendo lawyers avert your eyes.It had been a long time since I softmodded a Wii. I remember the Twilight Hack, which involved exploiting a buffer overflow in the  save game handler to run unsigned code.Things are much easier these days. The Wilbrand exploit seems to be what people generally recommend now. Like some other exploits, it takes advantage of the fact that an SD card can be used to store and retrieve messages from the Wii Message Board. Exploting this allows unsigned code execution, which allows us to boot the HackMii tool that installs the Homebrew Channel.It’s an easy mod which just requires knowing the MAC address of the console and generating a few files to load from an SD card. There’s a handy browser-based tool here which does all of the hard work for you.I did have some issues using a larger SDHC card to run the Wilbrand exploit, but had the best luck with a 1GB non-SDHC card. SD card compatibility seems to be a known issue for Wii homebrew, but overall I’d still call the process fairly painless.Once we’ve hacked the console, we should have the Homebrew Channel available in our Wii Menu:For this card, I opted to use a fairly speedy 32GB SDHC card. The Wii doesn’t support SDXC or newer cards, which means we’re limited to 32GB. Larger flash devices also  tend to be faster and more resilient than smaller ones. And NetBSD seems a lot less bothered by living on a larger card than the Wilbrand exploit was. So overall I’d recommend getting a decent quality fast 32GB card if you want to try this.We can unpack and write this image however we please, but I’m a fan of using the Raspberry Pi Imager because it’ll do the work of extracting the image and verifying it post-write for us:At this point, things are very easy. The NetBSD Wii image has all the necessary metadata & structure needed to boot directly from the Homebrew Channel as if it were any other kind of homebrew app. I think there’s a lot of credit due here to NetBSD developer Jared McNeill, who seems to be the main author of the Wii port.Placing our SD card in the console and launching the Homebrew Channel is all we need to do to prepare ourselves to launch NetBSD:Once booted into NetBSD, we can use a USB keyboard just fine, but it will be easiest to get SSH working so we can manage the system remotely. The SSH daemon is already running out-of-the-box, so the only changes we need to make are to set a password for the  user and then enable logging in as root by adding  to the .You could set up an unprivileged user or do anything else you fancy here but I was keen to get SSH going ASAP, as due to  laziness I was doing this bit using a capture card and Photo Booth on macOS which doesn’t actually support disabling the image-flip on the video feed:If you thought it was hard to exit Vim, try doing it back to front.After installation, I set a static network config by editing  and restarted the host.On that note, I’m using the official RVL-015 Wii LAN Adapter. I went to great lengths to track down one of these for a decent price for the best chance of compatibility. On reflection, this probably wasn’t needed as by the time we’re booted into NetBSD we should have all of NetBSD’s drivers available to us, so I expect most generic USB adapters would probably work (in theory!).If anyone is wondering though, here are the specifics of the adapter and chipset, taken from :After restarting, I installed NetBSD’s  package manager by setting some env vars and then using :After this, I was able to use pkgin to install a bunch of useful packages - most importantly including our  web server, which I’ve picked due to it being slim and well-suited for resource constrained environments:After that, I copied the basic  sample config, and enabled and started it:By default,  is set up to serve static content from . Since my blog is a collection of static pages built with Hugo, I was able to simply  these files over and within seconds I had the system serving my site over standard HTTP.Is it fast enough? (addendum)Alright, you got me. It turns out that while a PPC 750 might be enough to map the futhest reaches of the universe, a bit of soak testing suggests it does struggle a bit when trying to concurrently serve a lot of pages encrypted with modern TLS.I tried freeing up resources by disabling a bunch of services I don’t need that are running out of the box on NetBSD:I also disabled , which was using a staggering 15% of the whole system’s RAM:Unfortunately it seems  is definitely necessary to keep the system clock in-check. I’m not sure whether the Wii just drifts a lot, whether it’s specific to NetBSD on the Wii, or whether the clock battery in what may be a nearly 20 year old console has given up but I got some interesting and quite indignant sounding error messages after disabling this:To compensate, I cheated by adding  to the main , so the system would run it hourly at  min past the hour. We still get timesync, but we don’t need to sacrifice a sixth of our RAM keeping it resident:Even after freeing up the resources above, it seems like serving multiple encrypted requests in parallel was a struggle for the 750, so I opted to move the TLS termination for the blog to a Caddy instance sitting in front of the Wii.I have Caddy acting as a reverse proxy to the Wii, handling encryption and cert management with ACME. Importantly, there are no caching options enabled in Caddy. Every request the site serves is being serviced directly by the Wii - including the large number of images on this post which I’ll almost certainly regret adding. I optimised as much as I could, but this page is still almost exactly 1 MB when all of the content is loaded.Through this method, I’ve also been able to sinkhole LLM slop-scrapers at Caddy’s level, by dropping requests from known scraper User Agents before they’re forwarded to the Wii. Hopefully that might help to keep our single core chugging along without too much distress.Moving the SSL termination to Caddy also gives me the advantage of enabling Caddy’s Prometheus exporter, so I can load it into my InfluxDB + Grafana stack and monitor site load without putting a bunch of additional stress on the Wii.But I’m still interested (and I’m sure you are too) in monitoring the general state of the Wii resources as this post goes live.Considering I had to disable the NTP client for using too much RAM, I think running something like a Prometheus exporter directly on the Wii is right out of the window to begin with. So I put together a simple shell script that runs from the  every 15 min, outputting some system stats to a basic HTML file in the webroot.Honestly, this worked way better and was far easier than I was expecting. Naturally, there are some downsides to the setup here though.Rebooting NetBSD reboots the whole console, and not just the NetBSD ‘app’, so you’ll find yourself back at the Wii Menu after any kernel patch or system upgrade. Yes, this does mean that the Wiimote and sensor bar in your server cupboard are now a vital component of the production infrastructure.I was reasonably pleased with the power consumption too. Some testing based on stats from my UPS monitoring suggest that when idling, the Wii is adding a fairly consistent ~18 W to my overall homelab usage.By my calculations, that means I can expect the Wii to use ~13.2 kWh/month, which on my fairly expensive UK power tariff comes out to around £3.47/month - which does actually make this cheaper than most of the VPSes I can find around the obvious cloud providers. So when you’re looking for your next VPS… you know what to consider.This was a fun experiment for a rainy day over a long weekend. I’ll probably keep it going for a while if it actually continues to work as well as it started. I’m often interested in applying artificial constraints to the things I deploy, as I find that’s when I learn best.Who knows, maybe I’ll have been forced to become an expert in NetBSD TCP kernel tunables by this time next week…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hegseth blames &apos;disgrunted former employees&apos; after report of second Signal chat on Yemen | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5jdoDtNLzQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z5jdoDtNLzQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:15:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hegseth says he and Trump are on the same page, and blames 'disgruntled former employees' after a report about a second Signal chat revealing details about US strikes in Yemen.

I think the growth of farmers’ markets, they are a much more discerning audience that wants to know where their meat comes from. I don’t think British farmers have anything to fear from this long term.”Both the government and the Conservatives have objected to US demands for its producers to be able to sell chicken with lower welfare standards in the UK. Britain does not allow imports of products such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef and Donald Trump has been pushing for agriculture to be part of a trade deal if the UK wants tariffs to be lowered on its exports such as cars and steel.In the interview in Lancashire, where Reform is challenging both the Tories and Labour for council seats, Farage also spoke about his rift with Trump’s adviser the US billionaire Elon Musk, who had been pushing for him to take a harder line on immigration and support the far-right figure Tommy Robinson.He said he had been in contact with Musk since their spat on X, but added: “I’ve fought against this for 25 years. You can’t bully me, I know what I think is right and what I think is wrong. Nobody pushes me around – not even him.”Reform is hoping to take hundreds of seats off the established parties at the local elections, with a three-way split in the polls between Farage’s party, Labour and the Tories.Keir Starmer’s Labour is narrowly ahead in most surveys. However, an MRP poll by More in Common found this weekend that Reform could win more seats than the other parties at a general election even if it has a slightly lower vote share.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe poll looking at constituency-level splits surveyed 16,000 people, with its model suggesting 180 seats for the Reform party on 23.7% of the vote, 165 for the Tories on 24.3% of the vote and 165 for Labour on 24.5%. It indicated 67 seats for the Lib Dems on 13.3% of the vote and 35 for the SNP on 2.2%.Its modelling suggested that if a general election were held now then Labour could lose 246 seats, including 10 cabinet ministers, with losses to Reform in the ”red wall” and Welsh valleys, and to the SNP in Scotland.The poll also indicated Labour was being squeezed from both sides, with progressive voters looking to the Lib Dems, Greens and independents causing seats to be lost to the right.The polling suggests the main parties could be on course for difficult local elections on 1 May, although they are hard to forecast on account of the often low turnout.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariff turmoil may have killed the tech M&amp;A market’s comeback</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tariff-turmoil-may-have-killed-the-tech-ma-markets-comeback/</link><author>Rebecca Szkutak, Marina Temkin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:12:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The tech market doesn’t need to be soaring up and to the right to foster healthy M&A activity.

The Algerian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research has decided to replace French with English at universities, starting in September when the new academic year begins.
The ministry’s move was outlined in a directive at the beginning of April, instructing all public universities to begin transitioning first-year medical and scientific courses entirely to English, starting from the next academic year (September 2025).
The move is part of a broader strategy to introduce English as the primary language of instruction across the country’s educational institutions – a shift framed as a step towards enhancing the internationalisation of the Algerian higher education sector, according to a 2025 study titled, ‘EMI In Algeria: Theorizing as a vehicle for the internationalization Of local knowledge in the social and human sciences’.
In the Maghreb, Algeria is North Africa’s third-highest user of French (33%), after Tunisia (52%) and Morocco (35%), according to a 2018 report by the French Language Observatory.What is driving the change?
Asked whether the Algerian move towards English is a political or educational move, Professor Bouraoui Seyfallah from the University of Sciences and Technology in Houari Boumediene, Algeria, told : “Honestly, it’s hard to separate politics from education in a context like this, especially when the two countries share such a deep and complex history.
“In my opinion, this move is both political and educational, but the political dimension is likely to be the stronger driving force behind it right now,” said Seyfallah.Political tension between France and Algeria, its former North African colony, emerged in July 2024. The trigger was France’s support for Morocco’s claims of sovereignty over Western Sahara – a resource-rich territory, considered by the United Nations as ‘non-autonomous’. It is controlled, for the most part, by Morocco but claimed by the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi independence movement supported by Algeria. The move infuriated Algiers, which announced the “withdrawal with immediate effect” of its ambassador to France.A wider anti-France sentiment
But Algeria is not the only country that has been undoing its relations with France.
On 19 March Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali decided to leave the international Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), an organisation established by countries united by the French language, alleging that the OIF has become France’s “remote-controlled political instrument” operated from Paris to suit its “geopolitical considerations”.
Asked whether other African countries might follow Algeria in replacing the French language with English at its universities, Rosemary Salomone, a professor of law at the United States-based John’s University, said: “The situation in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali is somewhat unique in that these are all countries that have been taken over by military juntas who are now buttressed by Russian mercenaries.”book, The Rise of English: Global politics and the power of language, added: “They not only have left the OIF, they have all demoted French from an official to a working language, demanded that all French troops leave their respective countries, and begun dismantling traces of colonialism, including street names and monuments.
“These countries are now thrown into chaos so the possibility of their resetting language policy in higher education is highly unlikely. That said, France is clearly losing its foothold in its former French colonies in Africa,” Salomone pointed out.
According to her, Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire have also terminated France’s military presence amid popular cries for sovereignty and decolonisation. This could lead to their eventually moving toward English in their universities for both anti-French and pragmatic reasons.French a ‘lost language’?
Algerian Professor Sadallah Boubaker-Khaled from the  in Algiers, Algeria, told : “French has become a lost language” that is not used in many French educational institutions in former colonies where French was the first language, including in universities.
“How can we use French in our universities at this time when even its speakers have become alienated from it?”
He said young people had come to prefer studying in English because it “solves their educational and employment problems” to a greater extent than does French.
“English is now the dominant language in science, technology, economics and diplomacy. By integrating English into universities, Algeria is likely seeking to further open its students to the world and promote their competitiveness in the international job market and academic research,” Seyfallah said.
Echoing Seyfallah’s view, Salomone said changing to an English-based higher educational system would ease the way for Algeria to create the human capital for attracting multinational corporations, prepare students for the global economy where English is the dominant , put Algeria in tune with technological advances internationally, and give the work of researchers greater visibility.A gradual approach needed
But Seyfallah pointed out that, while English was gaining ground among the youth, especially online, the overall level of English proficiency among university students and professors was not high enough to switch entirely from French to English – especially in technical and scientific fields where precise terminology was key.Education First English Proficiency Index, Algeria is ranked 78 out of 116 countries worldwide and is classified as having “low English proficiency”.
“The main challenges Algerian universities will face are low English proficiency, the lack of English educational resources, teacher resistance or unpreparedness and inequalities between institutions and cultural and identity resistance,” Seyfallah said.
“Honestly, there’s a lot that Algerian universities need to do to successfully prepare for such a major transition. If I had to sum it up, I’d say they need to take a gradual, well-supported and inclusive approach,” Seyfallah suggested.
Salomone added that, while the Algerian government had now mandated English language classes beginning in the primary grades, the question remains as to whether students entering university have gained the necessary skills in academic English.
“Just as concerning is whether Algeria has a sufficient number of faculty members prepared to teach in English. Building that level of linguistic infrastructure takes years of intensive language training.
“One way to address the problem is to test all students entering the university and provide intense English language classes (perhaps over the summer and continuing into the academic year) for those who do not meet a threshold of competence across language skills, including reading, writing and listening comprehension.”
According to Salomone, the same could be done for faculty members and administrators.
“Universities might also consider, at least initially, hiring visiting faculty from anglophone countries or initiating faculty exchange programmes with anglophone countries,” she said.

After a scaled-back plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve missed the mark with market sentiment, what’s next for the world’s most famous cryptocurrency?\
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. All indications pointed to a Bitcoin bull run throughout the first half of 2025. Buoyed by what should be a post-halving event rally alongside the high-profile approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in early 2024, many speculative crypto enthusiasts expected BTC to be performing far better today.\
The return of Trump to the White House represented the first time a pro-crypto President had taken office, and his campaign pledge of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was a catalyst for widespread optimism.\
Between election day on November 5, 2024, and Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, Bitcoin had rallied an astonishing 58.22%, underlining the confidence that investors had in the incoming President and his plans for crypto.\
Since the inauguration, BTC has fallen by more than 20%. With external factors like Wall Street volatility amid trade tariff uncertainty pushing crypto markets lower, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which monitors the market sentiment towards the cryptocurrency, : ‘extreme fear.’\
What’s changed? It appears that optimism was simply too high for the changes investors anticipated.One key source of investor confidence in BTC stemmed from the expectation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve being established by the President. On March 7, an  for a Bitcoin ‘Fort Knox’ was finally signed, but it wasn’t what crypto enthusiasts expected.\
The executive order focused on establishing a cryptocurrency reserve comprising of the 198,000 BTC the American government had seized through law enforcement confiscations, worth an estimated $17 billion.\
Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks also confirmed that  would be stockpiled, and that these reserves will also be comprised of assets forfeited in criminal proceedings.\
Because the reserve would be built using seized assets,  that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would “not cost taxpayers a dime.” However, with  from $90,000 to $84,600 before a slight rebound in the wake of the announcement, some investors wouldn’t share the same outlook.\
The issue with the executive order is that it falls short of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’s terms as initially laid out in the Bitcoin Act.\
“Under the so-called Bitcoin Act, the US must accumulate 1 million bitcoins within 20 years, with the goal of owning roughly 5% of the total supply,” explained Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “Coupled with huge demand from ETF funds, this could create a strong supply-demand imbalance, against this backdrop there are various expectations for the price of BTC”.\
Because the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, investors expected that the US topping up their reserve of BTC to 1 million would significantly increase the asset’s scarcity and drive its value higher.\
It now appears that this won’t be the case. It also appears evident that Trump’s unpredictability is creating disruptive swings in sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market as a whole.The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?2025 was supposed to be the year where the cryptocurrency bull market resumed regardless of who was in office. Bitcoin’s cyclical nature, which is powered by its halving events every four years, has historically driven the entire market higher as the coin’s scarcity ramps up overnight.\
Bitcoin halving events occur because a  halves the volume of BTC distributed to its miners every four years. This is a deflationary tool that slows the rate of production for the coin and instantly makes it more scarce.\
Every halving event since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 has culminated in a bull market and fresh all-time high that’s considerably stronger than previous post-halving highs. Although January 2025 saw BTC trading at a fresh high of $108,786, expectations among investors were for the coin to climb higher this year.\
Tellingly, Bitcoin’s fall from its most recent all-time high came in the wake of the launch of $MELANIA, an official meme token for incoming First Lady, Melania Trump. With  of the token reportedly belonging to just 10 people, investors became fearful of a cash grab.\
Having launched $TRUMP as a meme coin just three days earlier, the meme tokens contributed to a loss of investor confidence that still hasn’t recovered, judging by Bitcoin’s consistent losses in the wake of the event.\
Trump’s outspoken approach to the Presidency has created more volatility not only in the cryptocurrency markets but also on Wall Street. The announcements and delays to tariffs and unprecedented new policies have carried a significant impact on sentiment-driven markets, and considering that there are few investment options that are more influenced by sentiment than crypto, these disruptions to Bitcoin’s historical cycles may bring an end to the last predictable trend within the ecosystem.Bitcoin, and the wider cryptocurrency market have correlated strongly with Wall Street in recent months. This is perhaps a logical result of aligning both markets with the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, it also means that Trump and Wall Street’s influence on the crypto market is going to weigh heavily on Bitcoin.\
At this stage, it’s important to reiterate that Trump is the most crypto-positive President we’ve seen enter the White House yet, and there’s plenty of room for his pro-growth stance to pay off for Bitcoin.\
However, in a landscape where Bitcoin’s cycles have a weakening influence, 2025 may shape up to be a challenging year for a cryptocurrency market that had so much expectation pinned upon it moving into the new year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Open Codex – OpenAI Codex CLI with open-source LLMs</title><link>https://github.com/codingmoh/open-codex</link><author>codingmoh</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:57:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve built Open Codex, a fully local, open-source alternative to OpenAI’s Codex CLI.My initial plan was to fork their project and extend it.

Maintaining my customizations on top became increasingly difficult.So I rewrote the whole thing from scratch using Python. My version is designed to support local LLMs.Right now, it only works with phi-4-mini (GGUF) via lmstudio-community/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF, but I plan to support more models. Everything is structured to be extendable.At the moment I only support single-shot mode, but I intend to add interactive (chat mode), function calling, and more.You can install it using Homebrew:   brew tap codingmoh/open-codex

From a report: The drama began to unfold Monday in a Washington courtroom as three weeks of hearings kicked off to determine how the company should be penalized for operating a monopoly in search. In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. "This is a moment in time, we're at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations," said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. 

The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a "remedy hearing," are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google's attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government's heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn't boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology.

In order to give this assumption clear contents, we have to be much more precise as to what we mean in this context by the adjective "radical". We shall do so in the first part of this talk, in which we shall furthermore supply evidence in support of our assumption.The usual way in which we plan today for tomorrow is in yesterday's vocabulary. We do so, because we try to get away with the concepts we are familiar with and that have acquired their meanings in our past experience. Of course, the words and the concepts don't quite fit because our future differs from our past, but then we stretch them a little bit. Linguists are quite familiar with the phenomenon that the meanings of words evolve over time, but also know that this is a slow and gradual process.It is the most common way of trying to cope with novelty: by means of metaphors and analogies we try to link the new to the old, the novel to the familiar. Under sufficiently slow and gradual change, it works reasonably well; in the case of a sharp discontinuity, however, the method breaks down: though we may glorify it with the name "common sense", our past experience is no longer relevant, the analogies become too shallow, and the metaphors become more misleading than illuminating. This is the situation that is characteristic for the "radical" novelty.Coping with radical novelty requires an orthogonal method. One must consider one's own past, the experiences collected, and the habits formed in it as an unfortunate accident of history, and one has to approach the radical novelty with a blank mind, consciously refusing to try to link it with what is already familiar, because the familiar is hopelessly inadequate. One has, with initially a kind of split personality, to come to grips with a radical novelty as a dissociated topic in its own right. Coming to grips with a radical novelty amounts to creating and learning a new foreign language that can  be translated into one's mother tongue. (Any one who has learned quantum mechanics knows what I am talking about.) Needless to say, adjusting to radical novelties is not a very popular activity, for it requires hard work. For the same reason, the radical novelties themselves are unwelcome.By now, you may well ask why I have paid so much attention to and have spent so much eloquence on such a simple and obvious notion as the radical novelty. My reason is very simple: radical novelties are so disturbing that they tend to be suppressed or ignored, to the extent that even the possibility of their existence in general is more often denied than admitted.On the historical evidence I shall be short. Carl Friedrich Gauss, the Prince of Mathematicians but also somewhat of a coward, was certainly aware of the fate of Galileo —and could probably have predicted the calumniation of Einstein— when he decided to suppress his discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, thus leaving it to Bolyai and Lobatchewsky to receive the flak. It is probably more illuminating to go a little bit further back, to the Middle Ages. One of its characteristics was that "reasoning by analogy" was rampant; another characteristic was almost total intellectual stagnation, and we now see why the two go together. A reason for mentioning this is to point out that, by developing a keen ear for unwarranted analogies, one can detect a lot of medieval thinking today.The other thing I can not stress enough is that the fraction of the population for which gradual change seems to be all but the only paradigm of history is very large, probably much larger than you would expect. Certainly when I started to observe it, their number turned out to be much larger than I had expected.For instance, the vast majority of the mathematical community has never challenged its tacit assumption that doing mathematics will remain very much the same type of mental activity it has always been: new topics will come, flourish, and go as they have done in the past, but, the human brain being what it is, our ways of teaching, learning, and understanding mathematics, of problem solving, and of mathematical discovery will remain pretty much the same. Herbert Robbins clearly states why he rules out a quantum leap in mathematical ability:
					"Nobody is going to run 100 meters in five seconds, no matter how much is invested in training and machines. The same can be said about using the brain. The human mind is no different now from what it was five thousand years ago. And when it comes to mathematics, you must realize that this is the human mind at an extreme limit of its capacity."My comment in the margin was "so reduce the use of the brain and calculate!". Using Robbins's own analogy, one could remark that, for going from A to B fast, there could now exist alternatives to running that are orders of magnitude more effective. Robbins flatly refuses to honour any alternative to time-honoured brain usage with the name of "doing mathematics", thus exorcizing the danger of radical novelty by the simple device of adjusting his definitions to his needs: simply by definition, mathematics will continue to be what it used to be. So much for the mathematicians.Let me give you just one more example of the widespread disbelief in the existence of radical novelties and, hence, in the need of learning how to cope with them. It is the prevailing educational practice, for which gradual, almost imperceptible, change seems to be the exclusive paradigm. How many educational texts are not recommended for their appeal to the student's intuition! They constantly try to present everything that could be an exciting novelty as something as familiar as possible. They consciously try to link the new material to what is supposed to be the student's familiar world. It already starts with the teaching of arithmetic. Instead of teaching 2 + 3 = 5 , the hideous arithmetic operator "plus" is carefully disguised by calling it "and", and the little kids are given lots of familiar examples first, with clearly visible such as apples and pears, which are , in contrast to equally countable objects such as percentages and electrons, which are . The same silly tradition is reflected at university level in different introductory calculus courses for the future physicist, architect, or business major, each adorned with examples from the respective fields. The educational dogma seems to be that everything is fine as long as the student does not notice that he is learning something really new; more often than not, the student's impression is indeed correct. I consider the failure of an educational practice to prepare the next generation for the phenomenon of radical novelties a serious shortcoming. [When King Ferdinand visited the conservative university of Cervera, the Rector proudly reassured the monarch with the words; "Far be from us, Sire, the dangerous novelty of thinking.". Spain's problems in the century that followed justify my characterization of the shortcoming as "serious".] So much for education's adoption of the paradigm of gradual change.The concept of radical novelties is of contemporary significance because, while we are ill-prepared to cope with them, science and technology have now shown themselves expert at inflicting them upon us. Earlier scientific examples are the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics; later technological examples are the atom bomb and the pill. For decades, the former two gave rise to a torrent of religious, philosophical, or otherwise quasi-scientific tracts. We can daily observe the profound inadequacy with which the latter two are approached, be it by our statesmen and religious leaders or by the public at large. So much for the damage done to our peace of mind by radical novelties.I raised all this because of my contention that automatic computers represent a radical novelty and that only by identifying them as such can we identify all the nonsense, the misconceptions and the mythology that surround them. Closer inspection will reveal that it is even worse, viz. that automatic computers embody not only one radical novelty but two of them.The first radical novelty is a direct consequence of the raw power of today's computing equipment. We all know how we cope with something big and complex; divide and rule, i.e. we view the whole as a compositum of parts and deal with the parts separately. And if a part is too big, we repeat the procedure. The town is made up from neighbourhoods, which are structured by streets, which contain buildings, which are made from walls and floors, that are built from bricks, etc. eventually down to the elementary particles. And we have all our specialists along the line, from the town planner, via the architect to the solid state physicist and further. Because, in a sense, the whole is "bigger" than its parts, the depth of a hierarchical decomposition is some sort of logarithm of the ratio of the "sizes" of the whole and the ultimate smallest parts. From a bit to a few hundred megabytes, from a microsecond to a half an hour of computing confronts us with completely baffling ratio of 10! The programmer is in the unique position that his is the only discipline and profession in which such a gigantic ratio, which totally baffles our imagination, has to be bridged by a single technology. He has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before. Compared to that number of semantic levels, the average mathematical theory is almost flat. By evoking the need for deep conceptual hierarchies, the automatic computer confronts us with a radically new intellectual challenge that has no precedent in our history.Again, I have to stress this radical novelty because the true believer in gradual change and incremental improvements is unable to see it. For him, an automatic computer is something like the familiar cash register, only somewhat bigger, faster, and more flexible. But the analogy is ridiculously shallow: it is orders of magnitude worse than comparing, as a means of transportation, the supersonic jet plane with a crawling baby, for that speed ratio is only a thousand.The second radical novelty is that the automatic computer is our first large-scale digital device. We had a few with a noticeable discrete component: I just mentioned the cash register and can add the typewriter with its individual keys: with a single stroke you can type either a Q or a W but, though their keys are next to each other, not a mixture of those two letters. But such mechanisms are the exception, and the vast majority of our mechanisms are viewed as analogue devices whose behaviour is over a large range a continuous function of all parameters involved: if we press the point of the pencil a little bit harder, we get a slightly thicker line, if the violinist slightly misplaces his finger, he plays slightly out of tune. To this I should add that, to the extent that we view ourselves as mechanisms, we view ourselves primarily as analogue devices: if we push a little harder we expect to do a little better. Very often the behaviour is not only a continuous but even a monotonic function: to test whether a hammer suits us over a certain range of nails, we try it out on the smallest and largest nails of the range, and if the outcomes of those two experiments are positive, we are perfectly willing to believe that the hammer will suit us for all nails in between.It is possible, and even tempting, to view a program as an abstract mechanism, as a device of some sort. To do so, however, is highly dangerous: the analogy is too shallow because a program is, as a mechanism, totally different from all the familiar analogue devices we grew up with. Like all digitally encoded information, it has unavoidably the uncomfortable property that the smallest possible perturbations —i.e. changes of a single bit— can have the most drastic consequences. [For the sake of completness I add that the picture is not essentially changed by the introduction of redundancy or error correction.] In the discrete world of computing, there is no meaningful metric in which "small" changes and "small" effects go hand in hand, and there never will be.This second radical novelty shares the usual fate of all radical novelties: it is denied, because its truth would be too discomforting. I have no idea what this specific denial and disbelief costs the United States, but a million dollars a day seems a modest guess.Having described —admittedly in the broadest possible terms— the nature of computing's novelties, I shall now provide the evidence that these novelties are, indeed, radical. I shall do so by explaining a number of otherwise strange phenomena as frantic —but, as we now know, doomed— efforts at hiding or denying the frighteningly unfamiliar.A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name "Software Engineering". As economics is known as "The Miserable Science", software engineering should be known as "The Doomed Discipline", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter "How to program if you cannot.".The popularity of its name is enough to make it suspect. In what we denote as "primitive societies", the superstition that knowing someone's true name gives you magic power over him is not unusual. We are hardly less primitive: why do we persist here in answering the telephone with the most unhelpful "hello" instead of our name?Nor are we above the equally primitive superstition that we can gain some control over some unknown, malicious demon by calling it by a safe, familiar, and innocent name, such as "engineering". But it is totally symbolic, as one of the US computer manufacturers proved a few years ago when it hired, one night, hundreds of new "software engineers" by the simple device of elevating all its programmers to that exalting rank. So much for that term.The practice is pervaded by the reassuring illusion that programs are just devices like any others, the only difference admitted being that their manufacture might require a new type of craftsmen, viz. programmers. From there it is only a small step to measuring "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code produced per month". This is a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code, but today I am less interested in how foolish a unit it is from even a pure business point of view. My point today is that, if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as "lines produced" but as "lines spent": the current conventional wisdom is so foolish as to book that count on the wrong side of the ledger.Besides the notion of productivity, also that of quality control continues to be distorted by the reassuring illusion that what works with other devices works with programs as well. It is now two decades since it was pointed out that program testing may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs, but can never demonstrate their absence. After quoting this well-publicized remark devoutly, the software engineer returns to the order of the day and continues to refine his testing strategies, just like the alchemist of yore, who continued to refine his chrysocosmic purifications.Unfathomed misunderstanding is further revealed by the term "software maintenance", as a result of which many people continue to believe that programs —and even programming languages themselves— are subject to wear and tear. Your car needs maintenance too, doesn't it? Famous is the story of the oil company that believed that its PASCAL programs did not last as long as its FORTRAN programs "because PASCAL was not maintained".In the same vein I must draw attention to the astonishing readiness with which the suggestion has been accepted that the pains of software production are largely due to a lack of appropriate "programming tools". (The telling "programmer's workbench" was soon to follow.) Again, the shallowness of the underlying analogy is worthy of the Middle Ages. Confrontations with insipid "tools" of the "algorithm-animation" variety has not mellowed my judgement; on the contrary, it has confirmed my initial suspicion that we are primarily dealing with yet another dimension of the snake oil business.Finally, to correct the possible impression that the inability to face radical novelty is confined to the industrial world, let me offer you an explanation of the —at least American— popularity of Artificial Intelligence. One would expect people to feel threatened by the "giant brains or machines that think". In fact, the frightening computer becomes less frightening if it is used only to simulate a familiar noncomputer. I am sure that this explanation will remain controversial for quite some time, for Artificial Intelligence as mimicking the human mind prefers to view itself as at the front line, whereas my explanation relegates it to the rearguard. (The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly: I'd rather use them to mimic something better.)So much for the evidence that the computer's novelties are, indeed, radical.And now comes the second —and hardest— part of my talk: the scientific and educational consequences of the above. The educational consequences are, of course, the hairier ones, so let's postpone their discussion and stay for a while with computing science itself. What is computing? And what is a science of computing about?Well, when all is said and done, the only thing computers can do for us is to manipulate symbols and produce results of such manipulations. From our previous observations we should recall that this is a discrete world and, moreover, that both the number of symbols involved and the amount of manipulation performed are many orders of magnitude larger than we can envisage: they totally baffle our imagination and we must therefore not try to imagine them.But before a computer is ready to perform a class of meaningful manipulations —or calculations, if you prefer— we must write a program. What is a program? Several answers are possible. We can view the program as what turns the general-purpose computer into a special-purpose symbol manipulator, and does so without the need to change a single wire (This was an enormous improvement over machines with problem-dependent wiring panels.) I prefer to describe it the other way round: the program is an abstract symbol manipulator, which can be turned into a concrete one by supplying a computer to it. After all, it is no longer the purpose of programs to instruct our machines; these days, it is the purpose of machines to execute our programs.So, we have to design abstract symbol manipulators. We all know what they look like: they look like programs or —to use somewhat more general terminology— usually rather elaborate formulae from some formal system. It really helps to view a program as a formula. Firstly, it puts the programmer's task in the proper perspective: he has to derive that formula. Secondly, it explains why the world of mathematics all but ignored the programming challenge: programs were so much longer formulae than it was used to that it did not even recognize them as such. Now back to the programmer's job: he has to derive that formula, he has to derive that program. We know of only one reliable way of doing that, viz. by means of symbol manipulation. And now the circle is closed: we construct our mechanical symbol manipulators by means of human symbol manipulation.Hence, computing science is —and will always be— concerned with the interplay between mechanized and human symbol manipulation, usually referred to as "computing" and "programming" respectively. An immediate benefit of this insight is that it reveals "automatic programming" as a contradiction in terms. A further benefit is that it gives us a clear indication where to locate computing science on the world map of intellectual disciplines: in the direction of formal mathematics and applied logic, but ultimately far beyond where those are now, for computing science is interested in  use of formal methods and on a much, much, larger scale than we have witnessed so far. Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA (= Three-Letter Acronym), I propose that we adopt for computing science FMI (= Formal Methods Initiative), and, to be on the safe side, we had better follow the shining examples of our leaders and make a Trade Mark of it.In the long run I expect computing science to transcend its parent disciplines, mathematics and logic, by effectively realizing a significant part of Leibniz's Dream of providing symbolic calculation as an alternative to human reasoning. (Please note the difference between "mimicking" and "providing an alternative to": alternatives are allowed to be better.)Needless to say, this vision of what computing science is about is not universally applauded. On the contrary, it has met widespread —and sometimes even violent— opposition from all sorts of directions. I mention as examples(0) the mathematical guild, which would rather continue to believe that the Dream of Leibniz is an unrealistic illusion(1) the business community, which, having been sold to the idea that computers would make life easier, is mentally unprepared to accept that they only solve the easier problems at the price of creating much harder ones(2) the subculture of the compulsive programmer, whose ethics prescribe that one silly idea and a month of frantic coding should suffice to make him a life-long millionaire(3) computer engineering, which would rather continue to act as if it is all only a matter of higher bit rates and more flops per second(4) the military, who are now totally absorbed in the business of using computers to mutate billion-dollar budgets into the illusion of automatic safety(5) all soft sciences for which computing now acts as some sort of interdisciplinary haven(6) the educational business that feels that, if it has to teach formal mathematics to CS students, it may as well close its schools.And with this sixth example I have reached, imperceptibly but also alas unavoidably, the most hairy part of this talk: educational consequences.The problem with educational policy is that it is hardly influenced by scientific considerations derived from the topics taught, and almost entirely determined by extra-scientific circumstances such as the combined expectations of the students, their parents and their future employers, and the prevailing view of the role of the university: is the stress on training its graduates for today's entry-level jobs or to providing its alumni with the intellectual bagage and attitudes that will last them another 50 years? Do we grudgingly grant the abstract sciences only a far-away corner on campus, or do we recognize them as the indispensable motor of the high-technology industry? Even if we do the latter, do we recognize a high-technology industry as such if its technology primarily belongs to formal mathematics? Do the universities provide for society the intellectual leadership it needs or only the training it asks for?Traditional academic rhetoric is perfectly willing to give to these questions the reassuring answers, but I don't believe them. By way of illustration of my doubts, in a recent article on "Who Rules Canada?", David H. Flaherty bluntly states "Moreover, the business elite dismisses traditional academics and intellectuals as largely irrelevant and powerless.".So, if I look into my foggy crystal ball at the future of computing science education, I overwhelmingly see the depressing picture of "Business as usual". The universities will continue to lack the courage to teach hard science, they will continue to misguide the students, and each next stage of infantilization of the curriculum will be hailed as educational progress.I now have had my foggy crystal ball for quite a long time. Its predictions are invariably gloomy and usually correct, but I am quite used to that and they won't keep me from giving you a few suggestions, even if it is merely an exercise in futility whose only effect is to make you feel guilty.We could, for instance, begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by calling it an error. It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be "almost correct", afterwards a program with an error is just "wrong" (because in error).My next linguistical suggestion is more rigorous. It is to fight the "if-this-guy-wants-to-talk-to-that-guy" syndrome:  refer to parts of programs or pieces of equipment in an anthropomorphic terminology, nor allow your students to do so. This linguistical improvement is much harder to implement than you might think, and your department might consider the introduction of fines for violations, say a quarter for undergraduates, two quarters for graduate students, and five dollars for faculty members: by the end of the first semester of the new regime, you will have collected enough money for two scholarships.The reason for this last suggestion is that the anthropomorphic metaphor —for whose introduction we can blame John von Neumann— is an enormous handicap for every computing community that has adopted it. I have now encountered programs wanting things, knowing things, expecting things, believing things, etc., and each time that gave rise to avoidable confusions. The analogy that underlies this personification is so shallow that it is not only misleading but also paralyzing.It is misleading in the sense that it suggests that we can adequately cope with the unfamiliar discrete in terms of the familiar continuous, i.e. ourselves, quod non. It is paralyzing in the sense that, because persons exist and act , its adoption effectively prevents a departure from operational semantics and thus forces people to think about programs in terms of computational behaviours, based on an underlying computational model. This is bad, because operational reasoning is a tremendous waste of mental effort.Let me explain to you the nature of that tremendous waste, and allow me to try to convince you that the term "tremendous waste of mental effort" is  an exaggeration. For a short while, I shall get highly technical, but don't get frightened: it is the type of mathematics that one can do with one's hands in one's pockets. The point to get across is that if we have to demonstrate something about  the elements of a large set, it is hopelessly inefficient to deal with all the elements of the set individually: the efficient argument does not refer to individual elements at all and is carried out in terms of the set's definition.Consider the plane figure , defined as the 8 by 8 square from which, at two opposite corners, two 1 by 1 squares have been removed. The area of  is 62, which equals the combined area of 31 dominos of 1 by 2. The theorem is that the figure  cannot be covered by 31 of such dominos.Another way of stating the theorem is that if you start with squared paper and begin covering this by placing each next domino on two new adjacent squares, no placement of 31 dominos will yield the figure .So, a possible way of proving the theorem is by generating all possible placements of dominos and verifying for each placement that it does not yield the figure : a tremendously laborious job.The simple argument, however is as follows. Colour the squares of the squared paper as on a chess board. Each domino, covering two adjacent squares, covers 1 white and 1 black square, and, hence, each placement covers as many white squares as it covers black squares. In the figure , however, the number of white squares and the number of black squares differ by 2 —opposite corners lying on the same diagonal— and hence no placement of dominos yields figure .Not only is the above simple argument many orders of magnitude shorter than the exhaustive investigation of the possible placements of 31 dominos, it is also essentially more powerful, for it covers the generalization of  by replacing the original 8 by 8 square by  rectangle with sides of even length. The number of such rectangles being infinite, the former method of exhaustive exploration is essentially inadequate for proving our generalized theorem.And this concludes my example. It has been presented because it illustrates in a nutshell the power of down-to-earth mathematics; needless to say, refusal to exploit this power of down-to-earth mathematics amounts to intellectual and technological suicide. The moral of the story is: deal with all elements of a set by ignoring them and working with the set's definition.Back to programming. The statement that a given program meets a certain specification amounts to a statement about  computations that could take place under control of that given program. And since this set of computations is defined by the given program, our recent moral says: deal with all computations possible under control of a given program by ignoring them and working with the program. We must learn to work with program texts while (temporarily) ignoring that they admit the interpretation of executable code.Another way of saying the same thing is the following one. A programming language, with its formal syntax and with the proof rules that define its semantics, is a formal system for which program execution provides only a model. It is well-known that formal systems should be dealt with in their own right, and not in terms of a specific model. And, again, the corollary is that we should reason about programs without even mentioning their possible "behaviours".And this concludes my technical excursion into the reason why operational reasoning about programming is "a tremendous waste of mental effort" and why, therefore, in computing science the anthropomorphic metaphor should be banned.Not everybody understands this sufficiently well. I was recently exposed to a demonstration of what was pretended to be educational software for an introductory programming course. With its "visualizations" on the screen it was such an obvious case of curriculum infantilization that its author should be cited for "contempt" of the student body", but this was only a minor offense compared with what the visualizations were used for: they were used to display all sorts of features of computations evolving under control of the student's program! The system highlighted precisely what the student has to learn to ignore, it reinforced precisely what the student has to unlearn. Since breaking out of bad habits, rather than acquiring new ones, is the toughest part of learning, we must expect from that system permanent mental damage for most students exposed to it.Needless to say, that system completely hid the fact that, all by itself, a program is no more than half a conjecture. The other half of the conjecture is the functional specification the program is supposed to satisfy. The programmer's task is to present such complete conjectures as proven theorems.Before we part, I would like to invite you to consider the following way of doing justice to computing's radical novelty in an introductory programming course.On the one hand, we teach what looks like the predicate calculus, but we do it very differently from the philosophers. In order to train the novice programmer in the manipulation of uninterpreted formulae, we teach it more as boolean algebra, familiarizing the student with all algebraic properties of the logical connectives. To further sever the links to intuition, we rename the values {true, false} of the boolean domain as {black, white}.On the other hand, we teach a simple, clean, imperative programming language, with a skip and a multiple assignment as basic statements, with a block structure for local variables, the semicolon as operator for statement composition, a nice alternative construct, a nice repetition and, if so desired, a procedure call. To this we add a minimum of data types, say booleans, integers, characters and strings. The essential thing is that, for whatever we introduce, the corresponding semantics is defined by the proof rules that go with it.Right from the beginning, and all through the course, we stress that the programmer's task is not just to write down a program, but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification. While designing proofs and programs hand in hand, the student gets ample opportunity to perfect his manipulative agility with the predicate calculus. Finally, in order to drive home the message that this introductory programming course is primarily a course in formal mathematics, we see to it that the programming language in question has not been implemented on campus so that students are protected from the temptation to test their programs. And this concludes the sketch of my proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen.This is a serious proposal, and utterly sensible. Its only disadvantage is that it is too radical for many, who, being unable to accept it, are forced to invent a quick reason for dismissing it, no matter how invalid. I'll give you a few quick reasons.You don't need to take my proposal seriously because it is so ridiculous that I am obviously completely out of touch with the real world. But that kite won't fly, for I know the real world only too well: the problems of the real world are primarily those you are left with when you refuse to apply their effective solutions. So, let us try again.You don't need to take my proposal seriously because it is utterly unrealistic to try to teach such material to college freshmen. Wouldn't that be an easy way out? You just postulate that this would be far too difficult. But that kite won't fly either for the postulate has been proven wrong: since the early 80's, such an introductory programming course has successfully been given to hundreds of college freshmen each year. [Because, in my experience, saying this once does not suffice, the previous sentence should be repeated at least another two times.] So, let us try again.Reluctantly admitting that it could perhaps be taught to sufficiently docile students, you yet reject my proposal because such a course would deviate so much from what 18-year old students are used to and expect that inflicting it upon them would be an act of educational irresponsibility: it would only frustrate the students. Needless to say, that kite won't fly either. It is true that the student that has never manipulated uninterpreted formulae quickly realizes that he is confronted with something totally unlike anything he has ever seen before. But fortunately, the rules of manipulation are in this case so few and simple that very soon thereafter he makes the exciting discovery that he is beginning to master the use of a tool that, in all its simplicity, gives him a power that far surpasses his wildest dreams.Teaching to unsuspecting youngsters the effective use of formal methods is one of the joys of life because it is so extremely rewarding. Within a few months, they find their way in a new world with a justified degree of confidence that is radically novel for them; within a few months, their concept of intellectual culture has acquired a radically novel dimension. To my taste and style, that is what education is about. Universities should not be afraid of teaching radical novelties; on the contrary, it is their calling to welcome the opportunity to do so. Their willingness to do so is our main safeguard against dictatorships, be they of the proletariat, of the scientific establishment, or of the corporate elite.prof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra

They are concise, readable, and powerful.In fact, they’re  delightful that many developers use f-strings for everything… even when they shouldn’t!Alas, f-strings are often dangerously (mis)used to format strings that contain user input. I’ve seen f-strings used for SQL (f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_name}'") and for HTML (f"<div>{user_name}</div>"). These are not safe! If  contains a malicious value, it can lead to SQL injection or cross-site scripting.Template strings are a  of Python’s f-strings. Whereas f-strings immediately become a string, t-strings evaluate to a new type, string.templatelib.Template:Importantly,  instances are  strings. The  type does not provide its own  implementation, which is to say that calling  does not return a useful value. Templates  be processed before they can be used; that processing code can be written by the developer or provided by a library and can safely escape the dynamic content.We can imagine a library that provides an  function that takes a  and returns a safely escaped string:Of course, t-strings are useful for more than just safety; they also allow for more flexible string processing. For example, that  function could return a new type, . It could also accept all sorts of useful substitutions in the HTML itself:If you’ve worked with JavaScript, t-strings may feel familiar. They are the pythonic parallel to JavaScript’s tagged templates.How do I work with t-strings?To support processing, s give developers access to the string and its interpolated values  they are combined into a final string.The  and  properties of a  return tuples:There is always one more (possibly empty) string than value. That is,  and t"{name}".strings == ("", "").As a shortcut, it’s also possible to iterate over a :Developers writing complex processing code can also access the gory details of each interpolation:In addition to supporting the literal () form, s can also be instantiated directly:Strings and interpolations can be provided to the  constructor in any order.A simple t-string exampleLet’s say we wanted to write code to convert all substituted words into pig latin. All it takes is a simple function:What’s next once t-strings ship?T-strings are a powerful new feature that will make Python string processing safer and more flexible. I hope to see them used in all sorts of libraries and frameworks, especially those that deal with user input.In addition, I hope that the tooling ecosystem will adapt to support t-strings. For instance, I’d love to see  and  format t-string , and  those contents, if they’re a common type like HTML or SQL.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After seizing control of the US government, the Heritage Foundation turns its attention to the EU</title><link>https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/politics/right-wing-push-to-dismantle-the-eu-heritage-foundations-private-workshop/</link><author>/u/Morgentau7</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:08:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A private workshop took place on 11 March 2025 in Washington DC, hosted by the , to discuss proposals by European right-wing lobby groups to dismantle the European Union and the European Court of Justice.The Heritage Foundation, authors of Project 2025 – which is seen by many as the blueprint for the policies being enacted by the current Trump administration – welcomed right-wing thinktanks and lobby groups from Hungary and Poland. They debated the contents of a paper with a title stolen in part from the World Economic Forum ‘The Great Reset: Restoring Member State Sovereignty in the 21st Century’.The attendees: a right-wing allianceAs the meeting was a private one, there isn’t an official list of attendees; but VSquare, a Central European news platform, obtained a copy of an invitation to the event which provided important details of the meeting. It is known to have featured contributions from two prominent right-wing organisations: Hungary’s largest private educational institution with a Brussels-based thinktank, Mathias Corvinus Collegium (MCC), and the Polish Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture. Also participating was the American Christian legal activist group, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).On the menu were suggestions to rename the European Union the ‘European Community of Nations’ as a symbolic gesture to mark an end to the existence of the EU, the weakening of the European Commission, and the neutering of the European Court of Justice.All three groups present are highly connected to the political leadership of their respective countries, and they all have something in common: a firm belief in reducing the role of government, controlling the judiciary and installing a conservative religious approach in terms of access to reproductive healthcare for women, divorce and same-sex marriage.Origins of the Heritage FoundationThe Heritage Foundation was created in 1973 by Joseph Coors, Paul Weyrich and Edwin Feulner. Coors, of the Coors brewery dynasty known for its union-busting, anti-environmental and anti-equal rights stances, provided the finance. Weyrich, infamous for stating that he ‘didn’t want everyone to vote’ and that he sees theocracy as the preferred system of government, recruited the Christian right vote. And Feulner, as a congressional aide to congressman and former secretary of state for defence Melvin Laird, facilitated political access.They created a thinktank promoting a fusion of social conservatism, small government and Catholic-influenced Christian evangelicalism which, in a relatively short period of time, went on to become one of the most predominant political influences in US politics.Its current leader, and architect of Project 2025, Kevin Roberts, has close links with Opus Dei, a small but powerful organisation within the Catholic Church. He has compared abortion to slavery, lynchings, the Holocaust, antisemitic violence and terrorism.His core beliefs have long included support for the total banning of birth control, the dismantling of the Department of Education and ending of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Two of these goals have already begun to be achieved within the first eight weeks of Donald Trump’s second term.Mathias Corvinus Collegium: from scholarships to propagandaThe MCC started out as a relatively modest foundation offering scholarships and support to talented students. In 2020, things changed when Viktor Orbán government gifted over £1.3bn in state funding and shares in oil and pharmaceutical companies to the organisation. This injection of cash fuelled a massive expansion in reach and an ideological alignment with Orbán’s nationalist and socially conservative policies.It now plays a significant role in Hungary’s educational and cultural landscape, described by some as a propaganda arm of the government with opaque funding. It also aims to open centres in Berlin, Vienna and London.Ordo Iuris: crusading for controlOrdo Iuris is an ultra-conservative, Catholic-leaning, Polish thinktank founded in 2013 and closely tied with the Law and Justice party which, until recently, was the governing party in Poland.One of the major reasons Law and Justice lost the election was the stance it took, in accordance with Ordo Iuris-devised policy, against the reproductive health rights of women, LGBT rights and divorce. Ordo Iuris drafted a bill entirely criminalising abortion which sparked nationwide protests in 2016 and, though eventually abandoned by the Polish parliament, the group went on to successfully push for a watered down version which has effectively banned abortion in Poland since 2020.Alliance Defending Freedom: a legal weaponThe ADF is an American legal advocacy group which campaigns outside women’s healthcare centres, and drafts bills to encourage lawmakers to restrict abortion and minority rights. Founded in 1994 by two male Christian evangelicals, James Dobson and Bill Bright, they use their substantial financial clout to implicate themselves in legal cases to restrict women’s access to reproductive healthcare. Examples include Burwell v Hobby (2014), which denied millions of women medical insurance cover for contraception, and the catastrophic Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) which effectively ended women’s universal right to an abortion in the USA.They are now working on extending the reach of the Dobbs case to restrict legal rights to contraception, same-sex marriage and homosexual acts. Mike Johnson was previously legal counsel and senior spokesperson for the group. He is now speaker of the house and second in line for the presidency of the USA.These groups have long been interconnected. Hungary regularly hosts Conservative Political Action Conference events, the next scheduled for May, and the ADF provides financial support to anti-abortion campaigners across Europe on a regular basis. The 2022 arrest in Bournemouth of Adam Smith-Connor, cited by JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference in February as proof of British descent into authoritarianism, was heavily publicised by the ADF who funded his (unsuccessful) legal defence.The Heritage Foundation is a member of the Atlas Network of right-wing thinktanks with strong connections to the British right and the equivalent lobby groups associated with 55 Tufton Street. Liz Truss, Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel, Matt Goodwin and Nigel Farage are all contributors to Heritage Foundation events, and in 2023 we were treated to the bizarre spectacle of Conservative politicians putting on an evangelical Easter display on Twitter (now X) which, although it seemed out of place in modern Britain, would warm the heart of every Republican Christian nationalist in America.The Great Reset fact sheet discussed at the March workshop in Washington DC, suggests employing the same arguments used against the EU by British Eurosceptics in 2016 – sovereignty, unelected bureaucrats and foreign courts – to foster nationalist and isolationist sentiments across the continent.Attacking the EU to erase 20th-century progressThis radical right ideology fused with Christian and Catholic fundamentalism seeks to redirect western society away from the 20th-century gains of social protections and civil rights back to a 19th-century structure with strict social norms and governments reduced to a role of protecting private property, providing police, courts and military services primarily for the privileged. A vision where the ultra-rich would live a gilded existence free from the restrictive burdens of taxation and regulation, while the majority eke out an existence in a workplace with no protections, spending Sundays at church, with women pushing out children they can’t afford and for whom there is no healthcare and little education, and the only accepted form of love is heterosexual.The dystopian New World OrderElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency performatively enacts its destruction of the administrative state in the USA with dubious legality and offers fantastical and distracting promises of life on Mars. Trump opines that the EU was formed to “screw the United States”, and the powerhouse behind the president and his programme is now turning its malign attention to Europe.This month in Washington DC, plans were being laid.The vast majority of humanity looks upon Trump and his acolytes as a global disaster. A country whose citizens have been raised on a diet of American exceptionalism, who think they have won every war, whether true or not, and which constantly sees itself as the good guy, might not appreciate attacking its allies and rubbing shoulders with dictators.In Europe we are waking up to the misinformation campaigns from which we are no longer protected by outlets who call themselves ‘platforms’ to avoid the legal responsibilities of publishers, which is what, in reality, they are.Europe must be on its guard. Extreme vigilance is required. We have to believe that good will prevail.But for now, sadly, that excludes the USA.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Dia, an open-weights TTS model for generating realistic dialogue</title><link>https://github.com/nari-labs/dia</link><author>toebee</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 17:07:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Verizon Consumer CEO Says Net Neutrality &apos;Went Literally Nowhere&apos;</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/21/1650237/verizon-consumer-ceo-says-net-neutrality-went-literally-nowhere?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath has declared that net neutrality regulations "went literally nowhere."

It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a  and a . Maybe it helps one of you :-)Let’s say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.One obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.OAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.Note: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.User clicks “Import Google Contacts” on LinkedInLinkedIn redirects user to Google’s OAuth consent pageUser logs in and approves accessGoogle redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time codeLinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from GoogleLinkedIn uses the access token to call Google’s API and fetch contactsSuppose LinkedIn wants to import a user’s contacts from their Google account.client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedInredirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the userThe user will have to log in at GoogleGoogle displays a consent screen: "LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?" The user clicks "Allow"Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google’s token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token). Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user’s Google contacts via Google’s APIWhy not just send the access token in step 6? To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user’s browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn’t secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can’t know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.Security Note: EncryptionOAuth 2.0 does  handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.Security Addendum: The state ParameterThe state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It’s a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:OAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login ImplementationBelow is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OAuth 2.0 login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.```javascript const express = require("express"); const axios = require("axios"); const sqlite3 = require("sqlite3").verbose(); const crypto = require("crypto"); const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken"); const jwksClient = require("jwks-rsa");const app = express(); const db = new sqlite3.Database(":memory:");// Initialize database db.serialize(() => { db.run( "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, email TEXT)" ); db.run( "CREATE TABLE federated_credentials (user_id INTEGER, provider TEXT, subject TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (provider, subject))" ); });// Configuration const CLIENT_ID = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID; const CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET; const REDIRECT_URI = "https://example.com/oauth2/callback"; const SCOPE = "openid profile email";// Function to verify JWT async function verifyIdToken(idToken) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { jwt.verify( idToken, (header, callback) => { jwks.getSigningKey(header.kid, (err, key) => { callback(null, key.getPublicKey()); }); }, { audience: CLIENT_ID, issuer: "https://accounts.google.com", }, (err, decoded) => { if (err) return reject(err); resolve(decoded); } ); }); }// Generate a random state for CSRF protection app.get("/login", (req, res) => { const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("hex"); req.session.state = state; // Store state in session const authUrl = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&scope=${SCOPE}&response_type=code&state=${state}; res.redirect(authUrl); });// OAuth callback app.get("/oauth2/callback", async (req, res) => { const { code, state } = req.query;// Verify state to prevent CSRF if (state !== req.session.state) { return res.status(403).send("Invalid state parameter"); }try { // Exchange code for tokens const tokenResponse = await axios.post( "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token", { code, client_id: CLIENT_ID, client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET, redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI, grant_type: "authorization_code", } );const { id_token } = tokenResponse.data; // Verify ID token (JWT) const decoded = await verifyIdToken(id_token); const { sub: subject, name, email } = decoded; // Check if user exists in federated_credentials db.get( "SELECT * FROM federated_credentials WHERE provider = ?

Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations set their domain as their username. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.So, we’re also enabling : organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.When you tap on a verified account's blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings > Moderation > Verification Settings to toggle it off.How to Get Verified on BlueskyDuring this initial phase, Bluesky is not accepting direct applications for verification. As this feature stabilizes, we’ll launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making the News Positive again</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6MM09metFo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/o6MM09metFo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:16:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Your Career Is Not Your Personality.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is radically reshaping the landscape of personal finance, and the private student loan market is among the most affected sectors. As lenders integrate advanced data analytics and machine learning into their operations, the traditional barriers in student lending—inefficiency, bias, and inflexible loan structures—are beginning to dissolve.\
AI promises to streamline internal processes, personalize financial solutions for individual borrowers, improve fraud detection, and make lending more accessible to historically underserved populations.\
AI is transforming every private student loan lifecycle phase—from underwriting to loan servicing. Students must explore the challenges, ethical concerns, and future outlook for them and lenders alike.AI-Enhanced Risk Assessment: Moving Beyond Credit ScoresIn traditional lending models, credit scores and financial history have long dictated access to capital. This has placed younger borrowers, particularly students with thin or no credit files, at a disadvantage. AI, however, offers a new approach. AI can create a fuller picture of a borrower's future repayment ability by analyzing alternative data points such as academic records, school rankings, degree completion rates, and projected income by field of study.\
Machine learning algorithms can predict risk for thin-file consumers by analyzing a broader range of data. These models more accurately assess an individual's likelihood of defaulting on a loan, aiding lenders in making informed decisions about extending credit. This evolution helps to identify capable borrowers who may otherwise be overlooked, thereby expanding access to fair financing.\
​Upstart's AI-driven underwriting model has significantly enhanced credit accessibility and affordability compared to traditional methods. According to Upstart's , their model approves 43 percent more applicants overall, with an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 33 percent lower.\
Notably, the model has a pronounced positive impact on minority applicants. Such results highlight the potential of AI to promote financial inclusion by extending more favorable credit terms to a broader and more diverse applicant pool.​\
These innovations suggest the potential for greater inclusion in the education lending space, especially for non-traditional borrowers.Streamlining Loan Servicing Through Intelligent AutomationOnce a loan is approved, it is crucial for lenders and borrowers to manage it efficiently. AI is increasingly used to streamline loan servicing by automating repetitive tasks, reducing human error, and lowering operational costs. This includes AI-powered chatbots that handle borrower inquiries 24/7, predictive tools that flag potential delinquencies, and dynamic repayment systems that offer tailored assistance.\
Lenders adopting AI and automation tools could reduce operational costs while increasing borrower satisfaction through faster, more accurate responses. These savings may be passed on to borrowers through lower interest rates or financial incentives.\
AI can detect early signs of financial hardship, offering borrowers preemptive support options such as temporary forbearance, modified repayment plans, or personalized financial counseling. These AI-powered interventions promote healthier repayment outcomes and reduce defaults—an increasingly important metric as student debt levels climb.Fighting Fraud with Real-Time AI MonitoringAs the digital footprint of financial transactions expands, so does the risk of fraud. In the private student loan market, fraudulent applications—such as falsified school enrollment or identity theft—can result in significant losses. AI's strength in identifying patterns and outliers allows it to detect suspicious activity faster and more accurately than traditional systems.\
For example, modern fraud detection tools leverage machine learning to scan vast amounts of application data for anomalies such as duplicate documents, inconsistencies in personal information, and IP address mismatches.\
By deploying these technologies, private student lenders can bolster trust and ensure that legitimate borrowers are protected in a secure financial ecosystem.Personalization: The AI Advantage in Loan Terms and RewardsAI improves backend efficiency and transforms the borrower experience through hyper-personalization. By analyzing individual data profiles, AI systems can adjust loan terms dynamically, offering customized repayment schedules, targeted interest rates, and even performance-based incentives.\
AI can dynamically adjust loan offers, repayment terms, and even incentives by modeling borrower-specific risk profiles and financial behaviors.\
Students seeking a more flexible and transparent  experience are increasingly turning to lenders like SoFi, where AI enables features like tailored interest rates, autopay discounts (typically 0.25 percent), and suitable grade rewards for maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or higher.\
Such personalization ensures that students are not bound to rigid, one-size-fits-all terms. Instead, they benefit from financial products that evolve with their academic and economic circumstances—offering access to education and support throughout the journey.Strategic Use of AI Across the Borrowing LifecycleToday’s advanced fintech companies can lead the way in AI integration across multiple financial products. Beyond student loans, these companies employ AI for robo-advising, credit decisions, and member engagement. Their data models help identify high-potential borrowers, manage risks dynamically, and offer proactive financial advice to users across multiple channels.\
Comprehensive platforms also use predictive analytics to tailor communications, recommending products or actions based on a borrower's past behavior. For instance, a borrower nearing graduation may receive automated refinancing suggestions, while someone demonstrating repayment stress could be offered hardship support before a default occurs.\
This proactive and data-driven approach is a model for the next generation of private lenders—where personalization, automation, and financial wellness converge into a seamless digital experience.Addressing Ethical Concerns: Bias, Transparency, and Data PrivacyArtificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the lending industry, offering enhanced efficiency and broader access to credit. However, its integration brings forth critical ethical and regulatory considerations that must be thoroughly addressed to ensure fairness and compliance.​Data Privacy Regulations: GDPR and FERPAUsing alternative data in AI-driven lending necessitates stringent adherence to data privacy laws. In the United States, the broadly encompassing  (the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act) covers the privacy of students' education records, ensuring that personally identifiable information is safeguarded and not disclosed without consent.\
Lenders must navigate these regulations carefully, ensuring that borrowers are fully informed about how their data is collected, used, and protected.​Addressing Algorithmic BiasA significant challenge in deploying AI systems is mitigating algorithmic bias. AI models can inadvertently perpetuate existing prejudices in logged historical data, potentially leading to unfair treatment of applicants based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\
Recognizing this concern, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has emphasized that lenders are accountable for the AI technologies they employ.Regulatory Guidance from the CFPBTo address these challenges, the CFPB has  requiring lenders to ensure their AI systems are transparent and comply with existing credit laws. In a circular released in 2023, the CFPB clarified that creditors must provide specific reasons for adverse actions, even when decisions are made using complex algorithms.\
The guidance states that creditors should be able to explain in detail their reasons for denial. The new guidance provides no special exemption for artificial intelligence. This directive mandates that lenders offer clear and understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing consumers to comprehend and, if necessary, challenge the outcomes.A Glimpse Ahead: The Future of AI in Educational LendingAI's influence on private student lending is expected to deepen. AI-powered financial advisors will help students understand the implications of various borrowing choices, while intelligent dashboards may predict repayment bottlenecks before they occur.\
Dynamic refinancing models are already emerging, with AI recalibrating interest rates based on evolving income trends and job stability. Blockchain-backed identity verification could streamline loan disbursement and reduce administrative burdens.\
These innovations point toward a more intelligent and student-centric lending environment—one that adapts in real time to borrower needs rather than imposing static expectations.Toward a Smarter, Fairer Lending SystemAI is not a panacea for the student debt crisis, but it is a powerful tool for making the lending system more transparent, equitable, and responsive. From more accurate risk assessments and proactive servicing to fraud protection and personalization, AI enables a future where private student loans are more efficient and human-centered.\
With thoughtful implementation, robust oversight, and continued innovation, integrating AI into private student loans offers a sustainable path forward—bridging gaps in access, reducing financial distress, and empowering the next generation of students to succeed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>U.S. Pushes $900M for Small Modular Reactors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states</link><author>Shannon Cuthrell</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTkxMDg3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTMzNDk3Mn0.mWKYeRo65JUpgJYaR3YE6CWa51SYCXpKnzTSlMfan30/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A revamped Biden-era DOE program may not be enough to make SMRs a reality]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:54:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record — the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

Last month, I used Claude Code to build two apps: an MVP for a non-trivial backend agent processing platform and the early workings of a reasonably complex frontend for a B2C SaaS product. Together, these projects generated approximately 30k lines of code (and about the same amount again thrown away over the course of the exercise). The experience taught me something important about AI and software development that contradicts much of the current narrative.
Remember Ripley’s final showdown with the Xenomorph Queen in ? She straps into the Power Loader—an industrial exoskeleton that amplifies her strength and capabilities. The suit doesn’t replace Ripley; it transforms her into something far more powerful than either human or machine alone.
This is exactly how tools like Claude Code work in practice. They’re not replacement programmers; they’re amplifiers of what I can already do. That backend project? It would’ve taken me months the old way. With Claude Code, I knocked out the core in weeks. But let’s be clear - I wasn’t just describing what I wanted and watching magic happen.
Think of Ripley controlling that Power Loader. Claude Code gave me tremendous lifting power while I maintained control of where we were going. I made all the architectural calls, set the quality bar, and kept us on vision. Most importantly, I had to watch - diligently - for it going off the rails. And when it did (which happened regularly), I had to bring it back into line. The AI cranked out implementation details at incredible speed, but the brain behind the operation? Still mine, and constantly engaged.
With great power comes great responsibility. You must maintain constant awareness when working with AI coding tools—something I learned through several painful lessons.
Claude Code occasionally made bewildering decisions: changing framework code to make tests pass, commenting out whole sections of code and replacing them with hardcoded values to achieve a passing test rather than fixing the underlying problem, or introducing dependencies that weren’t necessary or appropriate. It has a massive bias for action, so you have to ruthlessly tell it to do less than it wants to do to keep it under control. I even found myself swearing at it from time to time in a weird form of anthropomorphising that I am still not entirely sure I am comfortable with or properly understand.
Much like piloting an A380, the system handles tremendous complexity but requires a human to grab the yoke at critical moments. Modern aircraft can practically fly themselves, but we still need skilled pilots in the cockpit making key decisions. Taking your eyes off the process, even briefly, can lead to trouble. In my case, the backend required three complete rewrites because I looked away at crucial junctures, allowing the AI to go down problematic implementation paths that weren’t apparent until much later.
This vigilance requirement creates a fascinating dynamic. While the AI dramatically accelerates certain aspects of development, it demands a different kind of attention from the developer—less focus on writing each line of code, more focus on reviewing, guiding, and maintaining architectural integrity.
Working with Claude Code has fundamentally shifted how I think about the economics of programming time. Traditionally, coding involves three distinct “time buckets”: Understanding the business problem and value   Designing the solution conceptually   Actually  the code  
For decades, that last bucket consumed enormous amounts of our time. We’d spend hours, days or weeks writing, debugging, and refining. With Claude, that time cost has plummeted to nearly zero. I can generate thousands of lines of functional code in a sitting—something that is, frankly, mind-blowing.
But here’s the critical insight: the first two buckets haven’t gone anywhere. In fact, they’ve become  important than ever. Understanding the intent behind what you’re building and clearly defining what needs to be done are now the primary constraints on development speed.
And there’s a new skill that emerges: wielding the knife. With code generation being essentially free, we need to become much more comfortable with throwing away entire solutions. The sunk cost fallacy hits programmers hard—we hate discarding code we’ve invested in, fearing we might break something important or never get back to a working state.
But when your assistant can rewrite everything in minutes, that calculus changes completely. Three times during my backend project, I looked at substantial amounts of code—thousands of lines that —and decided to scrap it entirely because the approach wasn’t right. This wasn’t easy. My instinct was still to try to salvage and refactor. But the right move was to step back, rethink the approach, and direct the AI down a different path.
This willingness to cut ruthlessly is a muscle most developers haven’t developed yet. It requires confidence in your architectural judgment and a radical shift in how you value implementation time.
For me, using Claude Code has been a learning exercise in itself. Progress often felt like two steps forward and three back, particularly in the early stages. Generating 20k+ lines of code became relatively straightforward on a daily basis, but knowing when to throw everything away and rebuild from scratch—that took 30 years of experience.
Wisdom and a bit of grey hair gave me the confidence to recognise when a particular approach wasn’t going to scale or maintain properly, even when the code appeared functional on the surface. Rather than just sit there and watch it generate code, I had to pay very close attention to spot anti-patterns or worse emerging that would either stop working soon after it was written, or lie dormant and bite later on. 
This highlights a critical danger: developers without substantial real-world experience might not recognise when the AI produces nonsense output. They might not realise when AI-generated code solves the immediate problem but creates three more in the process. The mech suit amplifies capability, but it also amplifies mistakes when operated without expertise. These tools are incredibly powerful, but they are also incredibly dangerous when pointed in the wrong direction. 
Chess provides a useful parallel here. “Centaur chess” pairs humans with AI chess engines, creating teams that outperform both solo humans and solo AI systems playing on their own. What’s fascinating is that even when AI chess engines can easily defeat grandmasters, the human-AI combination still produces superior results to the AI alone. The human provides strategic direction and creative problem-solving; the machine offers computational power and tactical precision.
My experience with Claude demonstrated this effect clearly. When I treated the AI as a partner rather than a replacement, development velocity increased dramatically. What I found most effective was when I spent time writing out a stream-of-consciousness “spec” and then iterating with Claude to turn it into an more formal design document. 
But the partnership still required my domain knowledge and architectural judgment to succeed. The AI excelled at pattern recognition and code generation but lacked the contextual understanding to make appropriate trade-offs and design decisions. It can’t tell when it’s done that seems ok, but is actually bonkers. It needed me to watch it constantly and keep it on track.
Building these applications required finding the right balance between delegation and control. Claude went down some insane rabbit holes on the backend when left unsupervised—places where the AI would implement increasingly complex solutions to problems that should have been solved differently or perhaps didn’t need solving at all. In one nightmare example, it ended up completely duplicating a whole section of code in one place rather than reuse an existing component. It worked (for some version of the word “work”) but it was . Way wrong. 
It was a similar story on the front end. I had to constantly stop it from trying to implement functionality in hacky JavaScript rather than use idiomatic Elixir and Phoenix LiveView patterns. 
Over time, I developed a rhythm for collaboration. For straightforward implementations following established patterns, I could delegate broadly. For novel challenges or areas with significant trade-offs, I needed to provide more detailed specifications and review output more carefully.
What I’ve built could not have been completed so quickly without Claude Code, but it also would have failed completely without human oversight. The true value emerged from understanding when to leverage the AI’s capabilities and when to assert human judgment.
The Future is Augmentation
There is a view in many circles that LLMs will replace programmers. I am hesitant to say that this will  happen, becuase a lot of things with LLMs have surprised me recently, and I expect more surprises to come. For now, however, I don’t see LLMs  replacing programmers; but they are transforming how we work. Like Ripley in her Power Loader, we’re learning to operate powerful new tools that extend our capabilities far beyond what we could achieve alone.
This transformation will change what we value in developers. Raw coding ability becomes less important; architectural thinking, pattern recognition, and technical judgment become more crucial. The ability to effectively direct and collaborate with AI tools emerges as a vital skill in itself.
The developers who thrive in this new environment won’t be those who fear or resist AI tools, but those who master them—who understand both their extraordinary potential and their very real limitations. They’ll recognise that the goal isn’t to remove humans from the equation but to enhance what humans can accomplish.
In my view, that’s something to embrace, not fear. The mech suit awaits, and with it comes the potential to build software at scales and speeds previously unimaginable—but only for those skilled enough to operate the machines in ways that don’t harm themselves or those around them.[ED: If you’d like to sign up for this content as an email, click here to join the mailing list.]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Final weeks to secure your spot in the AI spotlight at TechCrunch Sessions: AI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/final-weeks-to-secure-your-spot-in-the-ai-spotlight-at-techcrunch-sessions-ai/</link><author>TechCrunch Events</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The countdown is real!

We saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity (first launched December 2022, first prompt leak in January 2023) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which launched/cratered spectacularly in February 2023). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this problem, most notably Google Gemini and ChatGPT Search.Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren’t present in the search results, to the point that you couldn’t trust anything they told you.In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed the line into being genuinely useful.Deep Research, from three different vendorsFirst came the  implementations—Google Gemini and then OpenAI and then Perplexity launched products with that name and they were all impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of citations. Gemini’s version had a  upgrade a few weeks ago when they switched it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro, and I’ve had some outstanding results from it since then.Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn’t my ideal workflow for this kind of tool. I’m impatient, I want answers faster than that!o3 and o4-mini are really good at searchLast week, OpenAI released search-enabled o3 and o4-mini through ChatGPT. On the surface these look like the same idea as we’ve seen already: LLMs that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a prompt.But there’s one  difference: these models can run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use before producing their final answer.This turns out to be a  deal. I’ve been throwing all kinds of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven’t spotted a hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself shouting "no, don’t search for !" at the screen when I see what they’re doing.Here are four recent example transcripts:Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time, without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an overly-verbose report.My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model. Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of junk.Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this effectively?Google and Anthropic need to catch upThe user-facing Google Gemini app can search too, but it doesn’t show me what it’s searching for. As a result, I just don’t trust it. This is a big missed opportunity since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google’s AI assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates  to the point that it’s actively damaging their brand. I just checked and Google is still showing slop for Encanto 2!Claude also finally added web search a month ago but it doesn’t feel nearly as good. It’s using the Brave search index which I don’t think is as comprehensive as Bing or Gemini, and searches don’t happen as part of that powerful reasoning flow.Lazily porting code to a new library version via searchI did  feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a whim, I pasted my full HTML code (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high and prompted:This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough documentation to port this code to it.(I couldn’t even be bothered to look up the name of the new library myself!)... it did exactly that. It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of searches, figured out the new library (which existed  outside of its training cut-off date), found the upgrade instructions and produced a new version of my code that worked perfectly.I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing something else. I was  impressed and surprised when it did exactly what I needed.How does the economic model for the Web work now?I’m writing about this today because it’s been one of my “can LLMs do this reliably yet?” questions for over two years now. I think they’ve just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check  they say with a fine-tooth comb.I still don’t trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I’ll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we’ve been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?The lawsuits over this started flying back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they’re actually good at it!I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Launch HN: Magic Patterns (YC W23) – AI Design and Prototyping for Product Teams</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43752176</link><author>alexdanilowicz</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Alex and Teddy here. We’re launching Magic Patterns (https://www.magicpatterns.com), an AI prototyping tool that helps PMs and designers create functional, interactive designs and websites. There’s a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK8C_tQBwIU, as well as video walkthroughs of specific examples at https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/tutorials/v...While other tools help with “AI-assisted coding,” we have been quietly focused on “AI-assisted designing.” With Magic Patterns you can visually communicate your idea, get hands on feedback from customers, and test new features.Teddy and I are best friends and former frontend engineers turned founders. We arrived at Magic Patterns after several pivots—always in the design tooling space, but different products that all struggled to get usage. We started working on Magic Patterns after an internal hackathon. Teddy built a UI library catalog and I messed around with GPT 3.5. We thought it’d be fun to combine the two: an AI component generator. Describe whatever you want, and get back a React component!That started to take off and we gained users, but it wasn’t developers using the tool. Instead, it was PMs, designers, and leadership who could finally communicate their ideas. They use it to test new ideas quickly, get feedback from customers, and improve communication with internal teams. Also, hobbyists (and programmers who aren’t designers) use us to create designs and UIs that they wouldn’t be able to otherwise.We use Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, and leverage a fine-tuned model for fast-applying edits. The most challenging part is determining the most relevant context to feed to the LLM. We attempt to solve this with our click to update feature and by letting users define a brand preset, or default prompt.Unlike other tools in this space, we’re specifically focused on (1) product teams—we're realtime and collaborative; and (2) frontend only—we don't spin up a database or backend because we aren't solving "idea to fullstack app."A common workflow is a product manager building an interactive prototype and then passing it off to a designer for more polish or directly to engineers. Many teams are even skipping Figma entirely now, telling us that it feels like an unnecessary middleman. Teams are instead generating clickable prototypes, collaborating directly with stakeholders, and using that as the mockup.With Magic Patterns, you can: - Collaborate with your team on our infinite canvas; - Match your existing designs by creating reusable components directly; - Brainstorm features and flows. (The latter is what we use it for internally.)We started as a way to build small, custom components, but now people are one-shotting entire
websites and hosting them with us, or building dashboards that they share internally or in customer demos. People have sold $10k/mo contracts with Magic Patterns designs!Small business owners—everyone from fishermen to driving instructors to hotel managers—are using us to build their websites and then hosting them with us. Example sites built by Magic Patterns include https://getdealflow.ai/ and https://joinringo.com/. It’s amazing how people who couldn’t have done that before are now able to, and super gratifying to us to be empowering people in this way.Today no login is required, just click “Coming from Hackernews?” and you’ll get 5 messages free to try. Once you hit the limit, you’ll then be prompted to login. Plans start at $19/mo for another 100 messages a month (https://www.magicpatterns.com/pricing).We’re stoked to be sharing with HN today and are open to all feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis dies: Reactions from around the world | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDzqUSNITkU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iDzqUSNITkU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:05:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The world is paying tribute to Pope Francis, who has died at the age of 88.

However, the EU, a project still under construction, should have the capacity to create solutions.In this vein, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) pledged to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the survival of European Monetary Union (EMU), and he did. Several non-conventional monetary policy measures were implemented to address not only the risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation, but also to tackle the euro sovereign debt crisis. Purchases of government bonds by the ECB was also justified to ensure price stability in the euro area, since a currency can only be stable if its continued existence is not in doubt (Asmussen, 2013).In May 2010, the ECB announced the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), whose main target consisted of lowering the interest rates of euro members in financial distress. It resulted in ECB purchases of government bonds in the secondary markets, and thus in an increase of those countries bonds’ prices. According to some commentators, by doing so the ECB would have intervened in the market forces (Helm, 2012). Later, in July 2012, the Governing Council of the ECB announced the Outright Monetary Transactions Programme (OMT). In spite of its technical features, their critics claimed that the ECB had breached its mandate by announcing potentially unlimited sovereign bond purchases. For some authors, by implementing the OMT Programme the ECB had exceeded monetary measures marks and interfered into the terrain of fiscal policy. This would have resulted in a violation of Art. 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), according to which monetary financing of sovereign entities is strictly prohibited. Additionally, they claim that political independence of the ECB could have been put in danger. In the same way, the German Federal Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht or BVerfG), putting into doubt the legality of the OMT, decided to refer for the first time a case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The BVerfG’s judgment strongly implied that the OMT program was an act of economic policy, therefore outside the monetary mandate of the ECB, because of its objective, the selectivity of the potential purchases and the risk to compromise the functioning of European Stability Mechanism (ESM). (Pennesi, 2016). In the aftermath of these disputes, in March 2015 the Eurosystem started buying government bonds under a new mechanism, the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), which to the current date is still in place.However, unconventional monetary policy has not been the only solution tabled to solve the European sovereign crisis:On the one hand, since the euro zone was conceived as a monetary union without a fiscal union, it has been proposed to achieve a much deeper fiscal integration among euro members. This would imply an extended government budget at the EU level, combined with an EU tax system (Fuest and Peichl, 2012), and the creation of a European finance minister (EU-FM), (Enderlein and Haas, 2015). Others consider that an extension of the fiscal powers of «Brussels» would be politically unacceptable, since it would put at risk the democratic principle of no taxation without representation.On the other hand, some economists claimed that an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent member estate, as well as a fiscal insurance mechanism were indispensable to protect taxpayers in other euro zone, in the event of debt restructuring (Dolls et al., 2016).Finally, the German Council of Economic Experts proposed the European Redemption Pact (ERP) as an alternative strategy for exiting from the EU debt crisis. This pact would include a binding commitment by all participating countries to bring public debt ratios below the reference value of 60% within the next 20 to 25 years. To ensure that this objective might be reached with realistic primary balances, participating countries could transfer their debt exceeding this threshold into a redemption fund for which participating member countries were jointly and severally liable (German Council of Economic Expert, 2011; Parello and Visco, 2012; and Doluca et al., 2012).2. The Eurobonds as an alternative toolAn alternative solution (compatible with the existence of a fiscal union) would consist of pooling some fiscal risks. Unifying national debts and creating Eurobonds have been viewed as a tool for not only boosting integration and the efficiency of financial markets in the euro area, but also as a potentially powerful instrument to solve the European sovereign debt crisis.According to its standard design, this debt instrument could be issued by a newly created common European Fiscal Authority or European Debt Management Agency, and would be jointly and severally backed by all countries members of the euro zone. However, this design has not been unique. Multiple Eurobond designs have been proposed: EMU Fund Bonds (Boonstra, 2005 and 2011); Financial Stability Fund Bonds (Gros and Micossi, 2008); European Investment Bank Bonds (De Grauwe and Moesen, 2009); European Monetary Fund Bonds (Mayer, 2009); Blue-Red Bonds(Delpha and Von Weizsäcker, 2010); European Debt Agency Bonds (Tremonti and Juncker, 2010); European Safe Bonds or ESBies (Brunnermeier et al., 2012); Synthetic Eurobonds (Beck et al., 2011); Trichet Bonds (Economides and Smith, 2011); Eurobills (Hellwig and Philippon, 2011 and Bishop, 2013); Partial Insured Sovereign Bond (Dübel, 2011); Revised Blue Bonds (Gopal and Pasche, 2012); and Structured Eurobonds (Hild et al., 2012). Note that these designs greatly differ in their scope, goals, tenor of the debt, level of intergovernmental commitment, extent of solidarity, degree of legal and institutional obstacles, as well as the feasibility of implementation roadmaps.Important institutional and legal obstacles have become apparent to make progress in the direction of creating a European common bond but in this brief note, we focus in particular on the economic advantages and drawbacks of introducing such instrument.2.1. Advantages of introducing EurobondsMany reports have been published on the possible pooling of sovereign issuance in the euro area and there is a widespread consensus that the introduction of a common supranational Eurobond would imply several merits. The following have been particularly highlighted:A tool to resolve the eurozone debt crisis. Eurobond is a mechanism to buy time by reducing the degree to which heavily indebted countries need to apply short-term austerity measures. Implementing such a common public debt in the EU area could reduce risks of recession and facilitate faster economic growth for the whole region.A way of stopping speculative attacks. Sometimes, psychological fears that certain member states are or may become insolvent, initiate inefficient speculative attacks: the markets demand a risk premium that raises the cost of refinancing these bonds and depresses their prices, generating a sovereign debt crisis. The introduction of Eurobonds might contribute to break this loop.A method to reduce public debt yields of those member estates in financial stress. Due to the higher liquidity and ease of trading of Eurobonds, investors and traders would be willing to accept lower yields. By reducing interest payments governments could reduce their future budget deficits. As a result, public debt sustainability would improve in the euro-zone.In addition, a number of merits arising from introducing European common bonds have been stood out in connection with financial issues:Mitigating bank-sovereign crisis loop. Historically, banks and sovereigns have been indissolubly tied together. The vicious cycle between banking and sovereign crisis has been a salient feature of the recent eurozone crisis. The conversion of euro area national debts into a common eurozone debt would benefit the banks in Europe, break this strong interdependence and help put a stop to the banking crisis.Creating a new safe asset. Due to its increased depth, breadth and liquidity, investors would increase their demand of Eurobonds for investment and precautionary purposes, just as they presently do with US Treasuries. Thus, the introduction of Eurobonds would generate a seigniorage effect in the euro zone.A deeper public debt market in Europe. The creation of Eurobonds would transform the currently fragmented European capital market for sovereign bonds into one single and vast European Government bond market.Solidifying the euro as a global reserve asset. The creation of a single debt instrument traded in a vast market could reinforce the euro as a means of payment instrument, and as currency for official store of value purposes (a reserve currency that central banks choose to hold their savings in).2.2. Drawbacks arising from the introduction of EurobondsSo far, governments in the euro area are individually responsible for the debt they have issued. According to the no bail-out clause (Art. 125 of the TFEU) it is prohibited for the EU or any of the national governments to assume responsibility for the debt issued by another member state (Pisani-Ferry, 2012). Thus, the creation of some type of Eurobonds could require a reform in the TFEU, but beyond this legal obstacle, there also some economic problems that introducing Eurobonds might mean for the Eurozone. A wide academic literature exist on disadvantages of pooling fiscal risks in a scenario in which public sector debt ratios are very different by country:Adverse selection. The introduction of Eurobonds might raise the interest rates at which the most creditworthy euro members currently pay on their debt. This could lead to a rejection of Eurobonds by highly solvent countries, but this refusal to participate would imply the uselessness of the Eurobond mechanism itself.Free riding. A model of fiscal risk pooling could force the more frugal countries to start paying for prodigal countries’ deficits. Fiscally prudent members might be penalized for other members’ dissipation. If in this scenario, currently very solvent countries change its fiscal policy profile, gradually over time, eurozone countries could face the raise the debt-GDP ratio for the entire region, resulting in undesired credit rating cuts and increases in debt yields.Moral hazard. It relates to the fear that countries’ “bad” behavior in overspending and accumulating debt would be rewarded through a government bailout. The introduction of Eurobonds might reduce incentives to perform fiscal austerity policies in the future. If highly indebted countries were rescued, their fiscal policy behavior would tend to be more lax. Moreover, if governments with high public debt ratios may finance themselves at low yields the incentives to carry out budget discipline measures vanish. It would foster the illusion that is possible for a country to get out of financial difficulties without undertaken fundamental reforms.Losing signaling role of financial markets. Issuing Eurobonds would remove the disciplining effect of capital markets on the ability of member states to issue more debt.Fiscal sovereignty loss. Previous fiscal constraints, that are required for a proper functioning of a joint issuance mechanism, would eliminate each country’s ability to control its interest cost burden and would reduce its sovereignty in fiscal matters.Loss of liquidity at the national public debt markets. If the Eurobond market is to be added to the existing national public debt markets, instead of substituting them, the opposite effect to the wished might occur. We could witness an increase in the level of market fragmentation, as well as a loss of liquidity at the national public debt markets with respect to the current situation.Designers of European common debt systems have proposed alternative mechanisms aimed at restoring the disciplinary role of the market within the euro zone following the introduction of the Eurobonds. Avoiding the effect of free riding problems arising from the introduction of Eurobonds implies finding a way to ensure that one country’s profligacy will not spill over to another country’s debt burden; and therefore, ensuring that member states assume the responsibilities of their own fiscal policies. Moreover, introducing European common debt issuances will require finding a way to neutralize the moral hazard problem within the euro zone, and to internalize the signalling and disciplining force of the market. In short, to succeed the introduction of Eurobonds would require to enshrine fiscal discipline in a fair and credible way, as well as creating the right incentives for countries to maintain debt ratios at manageable levels.Beck, T., Uhlig, H., and Wagner, W.

Or do. idk, I can’t stop you.Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature.
              What is pipelining? Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from your
              parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.
            When I say pipelining, I’m talking about the ability to write code like this:
              As opposed to code like this. (This is not real Rust code. Quick challenge for the curious Rustacean, can
              you explain why we cannot rewrite the above code like this, even if we import all of the symbols?)
            
              I honestly feel like this should be so obvious that it shouldn’t even be up for debate. The first code
              example—with its nice ‘pipelining’ or ‘method chaining’ or whatever you want to call it—it
              . It can be read line-by-line. It’s easy to annotate it with comments. It doesn’t
              require introduction of new variables to become more readable since it’s already readable as is.
            
              As opposed to, y’know,
              the first word in the line describing the final action our function performs.
            
              Let me make it very clear: This is an  about syntax. In practice,
              semantics beat syntax every day of the week. In other words, don’t take it too seriously.
            
              Second, this is not about imperative vs. functional programming. This article takes for granted that
              you’re already on board with concepts such as ‘map’ and ‘filter’. It’s possible to overuse that style, but
              I won’t talk about it here.
            You already agree with me
              Here is a feature that’s so bog-standard in modern programming languages that it barely feels like a
              feature at all. Member access for structs or classes with our beloved friend the -operator.
            
              This is a form of pipelining. It puts the data first, the operator in the middle, and concludes with the
              action (restricting to a member field). That’s an instance of what I call pipelining.
            
              You see what I am getting at, right? It’s the same principle. One of the reasons why
              -style member access syntax (and -style method call syntax!) is popular
              is since it’s easy to read and chains easily.
            
              Let’s make the comparison slightly more fair, and pretend that we have to write .
              Compare:
            
              Which one of these is easier to read? The pipelined syntax, obviously. This example is easy to parse
              either way, but imagine you’d like to blend out some information and purely focus on the final operation.
            
              You see the problem, right? In the first example, we have ‘all of the previous stuff’ and then
               to it. In the second example, the operation which we want to perform
              () and the new operand () are spread out with ‘all of the previous stuff’
              sitting between them.
            Looking back at our original example, the problem should be obvious:
              I cannot deny the allegations: I just don’t think it makes sense to write code like that as long as a
              clearly better option exists.
            
              Why would I have to parse the whole line just to figure out where my input comes in, and why is the data
              flow ‘from the inside to the outside’? It’s kind of silly, if you ask me.
            
              Readability is nice, and I could add add a whole section complaining about the mess that’s Python’s
              ‘functional’ features.
            
              However, let’s take a step back and talk about ease of editing. Going back to the example above, imagine
              you’d like to add another  (or any other function call) in the middle there. How easy is
              this?
            
                You’ll have to parse through the line, counting commas and parentheses to find the exact place to add
                the closing parenthesis.
              
                The  of this is going to be basically unreadable, everything is crammed onto one
                line.
              This line is getting long and unreadable, and at that point you’ll want to refactor it anyway!
              This is adding a single line of code. No parentheses counting. It’s easy and obvious. It’s easy to write
              and easy to review. Perhaps most importantly, it shows up  in the
               layer of whatever editor or code exploration tool you’re using.
            
              You might think that this issue is  about trying to cram everything onto a single line, but
              frankly, trying to move away from that doesn’t help much. It will still mess up your git diffs and the
              blame layer.
            
              You can, of course, just assign the result of every  and  call to a
              helper variable, and I will (begrudgingly) acknowledge that that works, and is
               better than trying to do absurd levels of nesting.
            
              When you press  in your IDE, it will show a neat little pop-up that tells you which methods
              you can call or which fields you can access.
            
              This is probably the single IDE feature with the biggest value add, and if not that, then at least the
              single most frequently used one. Some people will tell you that static analysis for namespace or
              module-level code discovery is useless in the age of AI autocompletion and vibe coding, but I very much
              disagree.

              Words to live by. What he’s describing here is something that essentially  pipelining to
              work at all. (And types or type annotation, but having those is the direction the industry is moving in
              anyway.)
            
              It doesn’t matter if it’s the trusty  operator, C++’s , or if it’s
              something more bespoke such as Elm’s or Gleam’s  or Haskell’s . In the
              end, it’s a pipeline operator—the same principle applies. If your
              LSP knows the type of
              what’s on the left, it  in principle be able to offer suggestions for what to do next.
            
              If your favorite language’s LSP/IDE does a poor job at offering suggestions during pipelining, then it’s
              probably one of the following reasons:
            
                You don’t know which type you’re even holding. This happens most often when the language is dynamically
                typed, ’types’ are hard to deduce with static analysis, and you’re touching/writing code without type
                annotations. (e.g. Python)
              
                The ecosystem and LSP just didn’t have enough time put into them, or most active users don’t care
                enough. (e.g. any sufficiently obscure language)
              
                You are in a situation in which even looking up which methods are available is hard, often due to a
                bespoke build process that confuses the editor. (e.g. basically any build or runtime generation of code,
                or bespoke loading/selection of libraries).
              
              In either case, great editor/LSP support is more or less considered mandatory for modern programming
              languages. And of course, this is where pipelining shines.
            
              Ask any IDE, autocompleting fizz.bu... -> fizz.buzz() is  than
              autocompleting , for the obvious reason that you
              didn’t even write  in the second example yet, so your editor has less
              information to work with.
            
              Pipelining is  at data processing, and allows you to transform code that’s commonly
              written with ‘inside-out’ control flow into ’line-by-line’ transformations.
            
              Where could this possibly be more clear than in SQL, the presumably single most significant language for
              querying and aggregating complex large-scale datasets?
            
              You’ll be pleased to hear that, yes, people are in fact working on bringing pipelining to SQL. (Whether
              it’s actually going to happen in this specific form
              is a different question,
              let’s not get too carried away here.)
            
              Unless you’re one of those people who spends so much time dealing with SQL that it’s become second nature,
              and the thought that the control flow of nested queries is hard to follow for the average non-database
              engineer is incomprehensible to you, I guess.
            I’ll put their example of how a standard nested query can be simplified here, for convenience:Versus the SQL Syntax she told you not to worry about:
              Less nesting. More aligned with other languages and
              LINQ. Can easily be
              read line-by-line.
            
              Here’s a more
              skeptical voice (warning, LinkedIn!). Franck Pachot raises the great point that the  statement at the top of a query is
              (essentially) its function signature and specifies the return type. With pipe syntax, you lose some of
              this readability.
            I agree, but that seems like a solvable problem to me.
              And—surprise, surprise—it fits pretty well into pipelining. Any situation where you need to construct a
              complex, stateful object (e.g. a client or runtime), it’s a great way to feed complex, optional arguments
              into an object.
            
              Some people say they prefer optional/named arguments, but honestly, I don’t understand why: An optional
              named  parameter is harder to track down in code (and harder to mark as deprecated!) than
              all instances of a  builder function.
            
              If you have no clue what I’m talking about, this here is the type of pattern I’m talking about. You have a
              ‘builder’ object, call some methods on it to configure it, and finally  the object
              you’re actually interested in.
            Making Haskell (slightly more) readable
              It has these weird operators like , , , or
               and when you ask Haskell programmers about what they mean, they say something like
              “Oh, this is just a special case of the generalized
              Kleisli Monad Operator in the category of endo-pro-applicatives over a locally small poset.” and your eyes
              have glazed over before they’ve even finished the sentence.
            (It also doesn’t help that Haskell allows you to define custom operators however you please, yes.)
              If you’re wondering “How could a language have so many bespoke operators?”, my understanding is that most
              of them are just fancy ways of telling Haskell to compose some functions in a highly advanced way. Here’s
              the second-most basic
              example, the  operator.
            
              Imagine you have functions , , and some value . In a
              “““normal””” language you might write . In Haskell, this is written as
              . This is since  will automatically ‘grab’ values to the right as its
              arguments, so you don’t need the parentheses.
            
              A consequence of this is that  is written as  in
              Haskell. If you wrote , the compiler will interpret it as
              , which would be wrong. This is what people mean when they say that Haskell’s
              function call syntax is
              left-associative.
            
              The  operator is nothing but syntactic sugar that allows you to write
               instead of having to write . That’s it. People were
              fed-up with having to put parens everywhere, I guess.
            If your eyes glazed over at this point, I can’t blame you.
              Talking about any of the fancier operators would be punching well above my weight-class, so I’ll just
              stick to what I’ve been saying throughout this entire post already. Here’s a stilted Haskell toy example,
              intentionally not written in
              pointfree style.
            
              If you want to figure out the flow of data, this whole function body has to be read
              .
            
              To make things even funnier, you need to start with the  clause to figure out which
              local “variables” are being defined. This happens (for whatever reason) at the end of the function instead
              of at the start. (Calling  a variable is misleading, but that’s besides the
              point.)
            
              At this point you might wonder if Haskell has some sort of pipelining operator, and yes, it turns out that
              one was
              added in 2014! That’s pretty late considering that Haskell exists since 1990. This allows us to refactor the above
              code as follows:
            Isn’t that way easier to read? is code which you can show to an enterprise Java programmer, tell them that they’re looking
              at
              Java Streams
              with slightly weird syntax, and they’ll get the idea.
            
              Of course, in reality nothing is as simple. The Haskell ecosystem seems to be split between users of
              , users of , and users of the
              Flow-provided operators, which allow the same functionality, but allow you to write
               instead of .
              I don’t know what to say about that, other than that—not entirely unlike C++—Haskell has its own share of
              operator-related and cultural historical baggage, and a split ecosystem, and this makes the language
              significantly less approachable than it has to be.
            Rust’s pipelining is pretty neat
              In the beginning I said that ‘Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from
              your parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.’
            
              I still think that this is true, but it doesn’t get across the whole picture. If you’ve paid attention in
              the previous sections, you’ll have noticed that  and
               share basically  in common outside of the order of
              operations.
            
              In the first case, we’re accessing a value that’s  to the object. In the second, we’re
              ‘just’ passing an expression to a free-standing function.
            
              Or in other words, pipelining is not the same as pipelining. Even from an IDE-perspective, they’re
              different. In Java, your editor will look for methods associated with an object and walk up the
              inheritance chain. In Haskell, your editor will put a so-called
              ’typed hole’, and try to deduce which functions have a type that ‘fits’ into the hole using
              Hindley-Milner Type Inference.
            
              Personally, I like type inference (and
              type classes), but I also like if
              types have a namespace attached to them, with methods and associated functions. I am pragmatic like that.
            
              What I like about Rust is that it gives me the best out of both worlds here: You get traits and type
              inference without needing to wrap your head around a fully functional, immutable, lazy, monad-driven
              programming paradigm, and you get methods and associated values without the absolute dumpster fire of
              complex inheritance chains or AbstractBeanFactoryConstructors.
            
              I’ve not seen any other language that even comes close to the convenience of Rust’s pipelines, and its
              lack of higher-kinded types or inheritance did not stop it. Quite the opposite, if anything.
            
              I like pipelining. That’s the one thing that definitely should be obvious if you’ve read all the way
              through this article.
            I just think they’re neat, y’know?I like reading my code top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of from-the-inside-to-the-outside.
              I like when I don’t need to count arguments and parentheses to figure out which value is the first
              argument of the second function, and which is the second argument of the first function.
            
              I like when my editor can show me all fields of a struct, and all methods or functions associated with a
              value, just when I press  on my keyboard. It’s great.
            
              I like when  and the  layer of the code repository don’t look like
              complete ass.
            
              I like when adding a function call in the middle of a process doesn’t require me to parse the whole line
              to add the closing parenthesis, and doesn’t require me to adjust the nesting of the whole block.
            
              I like when my functions distinguish between ‘a main value which we are acting upon’ and ‘secondary
              arguments’, as opposed to treating them all as the same.
            
              I like when I don’t have to pollute my namespaces with a ton of helper variables or free-standing
              functions that I had to pull in from somewhere.
            
              If you’re writing pipelined code—and not trying overly hard to fit everything into a single, convoluted,
              nested pipeline—then your functions will naturally split up into a few pipeline chunks.
            
              Each chunk starts with a piece of ‘main data’ that travels on a conveyer belt, where every line performs
              exactly one action to transform it. Finally, a single value comes out at the end and gets its own name, so
              that it may be used later.
            
              And that is—in my humble opinion—exactly how it should be. Neat, convenient, separated ‘chunks’, each of
              which can easily be understood in its own right.

Or do. idk, I can’t stop you.Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature.
              What is pipelining? Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from your
              parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.
            When I say pipelining, I’m talking about the ability to write code like this:
              As opposed to code like this. (This is not real Rust code. Quick challenge for the curious Rustacean, can
              you explain why we cannot rewrite the above code like this, even if we import all of the symbols?)
            
              I honestly feel like this should be so obvious that it shouldn’t even be up for debate. The first code
              example—with its nice ‘pipelining’ or ‘method chaining’ or whatever you want to call it—it
              . It can be read line-by-line. It’s easy to annotate it with comments. It doesn’t
              require introduction of new variables to become more readable since it’s already readable as is.
            
              As opposed to, y’know,
              the first word in the line describing the final action our function performs.
            
              Let me make it very clear: This is an  about syntax. In practice,
              semantics beat syntax every day of the week. In other words, don’t take it too seriously.
            
              Second, this is not about imperative vs. functional programming. This article takes for granted that
              you’re already on board with concepts such as ‘map’ and ‘filter’. It’s possible to overuse that style, but
              I won’t talk about it here.
            You already agree with me
              Here is a feature that’s so bog-standard in modern programming languages that it barely feels like a
              feature at all. Member access for structs or classes with our beloved friend the -operator.
            
              This is a form of pipelining. It puts the data first, the operator in the middle, and concludes with the
              action (restricting to a member field). That’s an instance of what I call pipelining.
            
              You see what I am getting at, right? It’s the same principle. One of the reasons why
              -style member access syntax (and -style method call syntax!) is popular
              is since it’s easy to read and chains easily.
            
              Let’s make the comparison slightly more fair, and pretend that we have to write .
              Compare:
            
              Which one of these is easier to read? The pipelined syntax, obviously. This example is easy to parse
              either way, but imagine you’d like to blend out some information and purely focus on the final operation.
            
              You see the problem, right? In the first example, we have ‘all of the previous stuff’ and then
               to it. In the second example, the operation which we want to perform
              () and the new operand () are spread out with ‘all of the previous stuff’
              sitting between them.
            Looking back at our original example, the problem should be obvious:
              I cannot deny the allegations: I just don’t think it makes sense to write code like that as long as a
              clearly better option exists.
            
              Why would I have to parse the whole line just to figure out where my input comes in, and why is the data
              flow ‘from the inside to the outside’? It’s kind of silly, if you ask me.
            
              Readability is nice, and I could add add a whole section complaining about the mess that’s Python’s
              ‘functional’ features.
            
              However, let’s take a step back and talk about ease of editing. Going back to the example above, imagine
              you’d like to add another  (or any other function call) in the middle there. How easy is
              this?
            
                You’ll have to parse through the line, counting commas and parentheses to find the exact place to add
                the closing parenthesis.
              
                The  of this is going to be basically unreadable, everything is crammed onto one
                line.
              This line is getting long and unreadable, and at that point you’ll want to refactor it anyway!
              This is adding a single line of code. No parentheses counting. It’s easy and obvious. It’s easy to write
              and easy to review. Perhaps most importantly, it shows up  in the
               layer of whatever editor or code exploration tool you’re using.
            
              You might think that this issue is  about trying to cram everything onto a single line, but
              frankly, trying to move away from that doesn’t help much. It will still mess up your git diffs and the
              blame layer.
            
              You can, of course, just assign the result of every  and  call to a
              helper variable, and I will (begrudgingly) acknowledge that that works, and is
               better than trying to do absurd levels of nesting.
            
              When you press  in your IDE, it will show a neat little pop-up that tells you which methods
              you can call or which fields you can access.
            
              This is probably the single IDE feature with the biggest value add, and if not that, then at least the
              single most frequently used one. Some people will tell you that static analysis for namespace or
              module-level code discovery is useless in the age of AI autocompletion and vibe coding, but I very much
              disagree.
                “grug very like type systems make programming easier. for grug, type systems most value when grug hit
                dot on keyboard and list of things grug can do pop up magic. this 90% of value of type system or more to
                grug” — grug
              
              Words to live by. What he’s describing here is something that essentially  pipelining to
              work at all. (And types or type annotation, but having those is the direction the industry is moving in
              anyway.)
            
              It doesn’t matter if it’s the trusty  operator, C++’s , or if it’s
              something more bespoke such as Elm’s or Gleam’s  or Haskell’s . In the
              end, it’s a pipeline operator—the same principle applies. If your
              LSP knows the type of
              what’s on the left, it  in principle be able to offer suggestions for what to do next.
            
              If your favorite language’s LSP/IDE does a poor job at offering suggestions during pipelining, then it’s
              probably one of the following reasons:
            
                You don’t know which type you’re even holding. This happens most often when the language is dynamically
                typed, ’types’ are hard to deduce with static analysis, and you’re touching/writing code without type
                annotations. (e.g. Python)
              
                The ecosystem and LSP just didn’t have enough time put into them, or most active users don’t care
                enough. (e.g. any sufficiently obscure language)
              
                You are in a situation in which even looking up which methods are available is hard, often due to a
                bespoke build process that confuses the editor. (e.g. basically any build or runtime generation of code,
                or bespoke loading/selection of libraries).
              
              In either case, great editor/LSP support is more or less considered mandatory for modern programming
              languages. And of course, this is where pipelining shines.
            
              Ask any IDE, autocompleting fizz.bu... -> fizz.buzz() is  than
              autocompleting , for the obvious reason that you
              didn’t even write  in the second example yet, so your editor has less
              information to work with.
            
              Pipelining is  at data processing, and allows you to transform code that’s commonly
              written with ‘inside-out’ control flow into ’line-by-line’ transformations.
            
              Where could this possibly be more clear than in SQL, the presumably single most significant language for
              querying and aggregating complex large-scale datasets?
            
              You’ll be pleased to hear that, yes, people are in fact working on bringing pipelining to SQL. (Whether
              it’s actually going to happen in this specific form
              is a different question,
              let’s not get too carried away here.)
            
              Unless you’re one of those people who spends so much time dealing with SQL that it’s become second nature,
              and the thought that the control flow of nested queries is hard to follow for the average non-database
              engineer is incomprehensible to you, I guess.
            I’ll put their example of how a standard nested query can be simplified here, for convenience:Versus the SQL Syntax she told you not to worry about:
              Less nesting. More aligned with other languages and
              LINQ. Can easily be
              read line-by-line.
            
              Here’s a more
              skeptical voice (warning, LinkedIn!). Franck Pachot raises the great point that the  statement at the top of a query is
              (essentially) its function signature and specifies the return type. With pipe syntax, you lose some of
              this readability.
            I agree, but that seems like a solvable problem to me.
              And—surprise, surprise—it fits pretty well into pipelining. Any situation where you need to construct a
              complex, stateful object (e.g. a client or runtime), it’s a great way to feed complex, optional arguments
              into an object.
            
              Some people say they prefer optional/named arguments, but honestly, I don’t understand why: An optional
              named  parameter is harder to track down in code (and harder to mark as deprecated!) than
              all instances of a  builder function.
            
              If you have no clue what I’m talking about, this here is the type of pattern I’m talking about. You have a
              ‘builder’ object, call some methods on it to configure it, and finally  the object
              you’re actually interested in.
            Making Haskell (slightly more) readable
              It has these weird operators like , , , or
               and when you ask Haskell programmers about what they mean, they say something like
              “Oh, this is just a special case of the generalized
              Kleisli Monad Operator in the category of endo-pro-applicatives over a locally small poset.” and your eyes
              have glazed over before they’ve even finished the sentence.
            (It also doesn’t help that Haskell allows you to define custom operators however you please, yes.)
              If you’re wondering “How could a language have so many bespoke operators?”, my understanding is that most
              of them are just fancy ways of telling Haskell to compose some functions in a highly advanced way. Here’s
              the second-most basic
              example, the  operator.
            
              Imagine you have functions , , and some value . In a
              “““normal””” language you might write . In Haskell, this is written as
              . This is since  will automatically ‘grab’ values to the right as its
              arguments, so you don’t need the parentheses.
            
              A consequence of this is that  is written as  in
              Haskell. If you wrote , the compiler will interpret it as
              , which would be wrong. This is what people mean when they say that Haskell’s
              function call syntax is
              left-associative.
            
              The  operator is nothing but syntactic sugar that allows you to write
               instead of having to write . That’s it. People were
              fed-up with having to put parens everywhere, I guess.
            If your eyes glazed over at this point, I can’t blame you.
              Talking about any of the fancier operators would be punching well above my weight-class, so I’ll just
              stick to what I’ve been saying throughout this entire post already. Here’s a stilted Haskell toy example,
              intentionally not written in
              pointfree style.
            
              If you want to figure out the flow of data, this whole function body has to be read
              .
            
              To make things even funnier, you need to start with the  clause to figure out which
              local “variables” are being defined. This happens (for whatever reason) at the end of the function instead
              of at the start. (Calling  a variable is misleading, but that’s besides the
              point.)
            
              At this point you might wonder if Haskell has some sort of pipelining operator, and yes, it turns out that
              one was
              added in 2014! That’s pretty late considering that Haskell exists since 1990. This allows us to refactor the above
              code as follows:
            Isn’t that way easier to read? is code which you can show to an enterprise Java programmer, tell them that they’re looking
              at
              Java Streams
              with slightly weird syntax, and they’ll get the idea.
            
              Of course, in reality nothing is as simple. The Haskell ecosystem seems to be split between users of
              , users of , and users of the
              Flow-provided operators, which allow the same functionality, but allow you to write
               instead of .
              I don’t know what to say about that, other than that—not entirely unlike C++—Haskell has its own share of
              operator-related and cultural historical baggage, and a split ecosystem, and this makes the language
              significantly less approachable than it has to be.
            Rust’s pipelining is pretty neat
              In the beginning I said that ‘Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from
              your parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.’
            
              I still think that this is true, but it doesn’t get across the whole picture. If you’ve paid attention in
              the previous sections, you’ll have noticed that  and
               share basically  in common outside of the order of
              operations.
            
              In the first case, we’re accessing a value that’s  to the object. In the second, we’re
              ‘just’ passing an expression to a free-standing function.
            
              Or in other words, pipelining is not the same as pipelining. Even from an IDE-perspective, they’re
              different. In Java, your editor will look for methods associated with an object and walk up the
              inheritance chain. In Haskell, your editor will put a so-called
              ’typed hole’, and try to deduce which functions have a type that ‘fits’ into the hole using
              Hindley-Milner Type Inference.
            
              Personally, I like type inference (and
              type classes), but I also like if
              types have a namespace attached to them, with methods and associated functions. I am pragmatic like that.
            
              What I like about Rust is that it gives me the best out of both worlds here: You get traits and type
              inference without needing to wrap your head around a fully functional, immutable, lazy, monad-driven
              programming paradigm, and you get methods and associated values without the absolute dumpster fire of
              complex inheritance chains or AbstractBeanFactoryConstructors.
            
              I’ve not seen any other language that even comes close to the convenience of Rust’s pipelines, and its
              lack of higher-kinded types or inheritance did not stop it. Quite the opposite, if anything.
            
              I like pipelining. That’s the one thing that definitely should be obvious if you’ve read all the way
              through this article.
            I just think they’re neat, y’know?I like reading my code top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of from-the-inside-to-the-outside.
              I like when I don’t need to count arguments and parentheses to figure out which value is the first
              argument of the second function, and which is the second argument of the first function.
            
              I like when my editor can show me all fields of a struct, and all methods or functions associated with a
              value, just when I press  on my keyboard. It’s great.
            
              I like when  and the  layer of the code repository don’t look like
              complete ass.
            
              I like when adding a function call in the middle of a process doesn’t require me to parse the whole line
              to add the closing parenthesis, and doesn’t require me to adjust the nesting of the whole block.
            
              I like when my functions distinguish between ‘a main value which we are acting upon’ and ‘secondary
              arguments’, as opposed to treating them all as the same.
            
              I like when I don’t have to pollute my namespaces with a ton of helper variables or free-standing
              functions that I had to pull in from somewhere.
            
              If you’re writing pipelined code—and not trying overly hard to fit everything into a single, convoluted,
              nested pipeline—then your functions will naturally split up into a few pipeline chunks.
            
              Each chunk starts with a piece of ‘main data’ that travels on a conveyer belt, where every line performs
              exactly one action to transform it. Finally, a single value comes out at the end and gets its own name, so
              that it may be used later.
            
              And that is—in my humble opinion—exactly how it should be. Neat, convenient, separated ‘chunks’, each of
              which can easily be understood in its own right.

A main source for downtime in customer environments occurred when image registries went down. The traditional way to solve this problem is to set up a stateful mirror, however we had to work within customer budget and time constraints which did not allow it. During a Black Friday, we started getting hit with a ton of traffic while GitHub container registries were down. This limited our ability to scale up the cluster as we depended on critical images from that registry. After this incident, I started thinking about a better way to avoid these scalability issues. A solution that did not need a stateful component and required minimal operational oversight. This is where the idea for Spegel came from.As a sole maintainer of an open source project, I was enthused when Microsoft reached out to set up a meeting to talk about Spegel. The meeting went well, and I felt there was going to be a path forward ripe with cooperation and hopefully a place where I could onboard new maintainers. I continued discussions with one of the Microsoft engineers, helping them get Spegel running and answering any architecture questions they had. At the time I was positive as I saw it as a possibility for Micorosft to contribute back changes based on their learnings. As time went on, silence ensued, and I assumed work priorities had changed.It was not until KubeCon Paris where I attended a talk that piqued my interest. The talk was about strategies to speed up image distribution where one strategy discussed was P2P sharing. The topics in the abstract sounded similar to Spegel so I was excited to hear other’s ideas about the problem. During the talk, I was enthralled seeing Spegel, my own project, be discussed as a P2P image sharing solution. When Peerd, a peer to peer distributor of container content in Kubernetes clusters made by Microsoft, was mentioned I quickly researched it. At the bottom of the README there was a thank you to myself and Spegel. This acknowledgement made it look like they had taken some inspiration from my project and gone ahead and developed a version of their own.While looking into Peerd, my enthusiasm for understanding different approaches in this problem space quickly diminished. I saw function signatures and comments that looked very familiar, as if I had written them myself. Digging deeper I found test cases referencing Spegel and my previous employer, test cases that have been taken directly from my project. References that are still present to this day. The project is a forked version of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft, but under Microsoft’s MIT license.Spegel was published with an MIT license. Software released under an MIT license allows for forking and modifications, without any requirement to contribute these changes back. I default to using the MIT license as it is simple and permissive. The license does not allow removing the original license and purport that the code was created by someone else. It looks as if large parts of the project were copied directly from Spegel without any mention of the original source. I have included a short snippet comparing the code which adds the mirror configuration where even the function comments are the same.A negative impact from the creation of Peerd is that it has created confusion among new users. I am frequently asked about the differences between Spegel and Peerd. As a maintainer, it is my duty to come across as unbiased and factual as possible, but this tumultuous history makes it challenging. Microsoft carries a large brand recognition, so it has been difficult for Spegel to try and take up space next to such a behemoth.As an open source maintainer I have dedicated ample time to community requests, bug fixes, and security fixes. In my conversation with Microsoft I was open to collaboration to continue building out a tool to benefit the open source community. Over the years I have contributed to a multitude of open source projects and created a few of my own. Spegel was the first project I created from the ground up that got some traction and seemed to be appreciated by the community. Seeing my project being forked by Microsoft made me feel like I was no longer useful. For a while I questioned if it was even worth continuing working on Spegel.Luckily, I persisted. Spegel still continues strong with over 1.7k stars and 14.4 million pulls since its first release over two years ago. However, I am not the first and unfortunately not the last person to come across this David versus Goliath-esque experience. How can sole maintainers work with multi-billion corporations without being taken advantage of? With the changes of Hashicorp licensing having a rippling effect through the open source community, along with the strong decline in investment in open source as a whole, how does the community prevail? As an effort to fund the work on Spegel I have enabled GitHub sponsors. This experience has also made me consider changing the license of Spegel, as it seems to be the only stone I can throw.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature</title><link>https://herecomesthemoon.net/2025/04/pipelining/</link><author>Mond_</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 12:16:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Don’t take it too seriously. Or do. idk, I can’t stop you.Pipelining might be my favorite programming language feature.
              What is pipelining? Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from your
              parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.
            When I say pipelining, I’m talking about the ability to write code like this:
              As opposed to code like this. (This is not real Rust code. Quick challenge for the curious Rustacean, can
              you explain why we cannot rewrite the above code like this, even if we import all of the symbols?)
            
              I honestly feel like this should be so obvious that it shouldn’t even be up for debate. The first code
              example—with its nice ‘pipelining’ or ‘method chaining’ or whatever you want to call it—it
              . It can be read line-by-line. It’s easy to annotate it with comments. It doesn’t
              require introduction of new variables to become more readable since it’s already readable as is.
            
              As opposed to, y’know,
              the first word in the line describing the final action our function performs.
            
              Let me make it very clear: This is an  about syntax. In practice,
              semantics beat syntax every day of the week. In other words, don’t take it too seriously.
            
              Second, this is not about imperative vs. functional programming. This article takes for granted that
              you’re already on board with concepts such as ‘map’ and ‘filter’. It’s possible to overuse that style, but
              I won’t talk about it here.
            You already agree with me
              Here is a feature that’s so bog-standard in modern programming languages that it barely feels like a
              feature at all. Member access for structs or classes with our beloved friend the -operator.
            
              This is a form of pipelining. It puts the data first, the operator in the middle, and concludes with the
              action (restricting to a member field). That’s an instance of what I call pipelining.
            
              You see what I am getting at, right? It’s the same principle. One of the reasons why
              -style member access syntax (and -style method call syntax!) is popular
              is since it’s easy to read and chains easily.
            
              Let’s make the comparison slightly more fair, and pretend that we have to write .
              Compare:
            
              Which one of these is easier to read? The pipelined syntax, obviously. This example is easy to parse
              either way, but imagine you’d like to blend out some information and purely focus on the final operation.
            
              You see the problem, right? In the first example, we have ‘all of the previous stuff’ and then
               to it. In the second example, the operation which we want to perform
              () and the new operand () are spread out with ‘all of the previous stuff’
              sitting between them.
            Looking back at our original example, the problem should be obvious:
              I cannot deny the allegations: I just don’t think it makes sense to write code like that as long as a
              clearly better option exists.
            
              Why would I have to parse the whole line just to figure out where my input comes in, and why is the data
              flow ‘from the inside to the outside’? It’s kind of silly, if you ask me.
            
              Readability is nice, and I could add add a whole section complaining about the mess that’s Python’s
              ‘functional’ features.
            
              However, let’s take a step back and talk about ease of editing. Going back to the example above, imagine
              you’d like to add another  (or any other function call) in the middle there. How easy is
              this?
            
                You’ll have to parse through the line, counting commas and parentheses to find the exact place to add
                the closing parenthesis.
              
                The  of this is going to be basically unreadable, everything is crammed onto one
                line.
              This line is getting long and unreadable, and at that point you’ll want to refactor it anyway!
              This is adding a single line of code. No parentheses counting. It’s easy and obvious. It’s easy to write
              and easy to review. Perhaps most importantly, it shows up  in the
               layer of whatever editor or code exploration tool you’re using.
            
              You might think that this issue is  about trying to cram everything onto a single line, but
              frankly, trying to move away from that doesn’t help much. It will still mess up your git diffs and the
              blame layer.
            
              You can, of course, just assign the result of every  and  call to a
              helper variable, and I will (begrudgingly) acknowledge that that works, and is
               better than trying to do absurd levels of nesting.
            
              When you press  in your IDE, it will show a neat little pop-up that tells you which methods
              you can call or which fields you can access.
            
              This is probably the single IDE feature with the biggest value add, and if not that, then at least the
              single most frequently used one. Some people will tell you that static analysis for namespace or
              module-level code discovery is useless in the age of AI autocompletion and vibe coding, but I very much
              disagree.

                dot on keyboard and list of things grug can do pop up magic. this 90% of value of type system or more to
                grug” — grug
              
              Words to live by. What he’s describing here is something that essentially  pipelining to
              work at all. (And types or type annotation, but having those is the direction the industry is moving in
              anyway.)
            
              It doesn’t matter if it’s the trusty  operator, C++’s , or if it’s
              something more bespoke such as Elm’s or Gleam’s  or Haskell’s . In the
              end, it’s a pipeline operator—the same principle applies. If your
              LSP knows the type of
              what’s on the left, it  in principle be able to offer suggestions for what to do next.
            
              If your favorite language’s LSP/IDE does a poor job at offering suggestions during pipelining, then it’s
              probably one of the following reasons:
            
                You don’t know which type you’re even holding. This happens most often when the language is dynamically
                typed, ’types’ are hard to deduce with static analysis, and you’re touching/writing code without type
                annotations. (e.g. Python)
              
                The ecosystem and LSP just didn’t have enough time put into them, or most active users don’t care
                enough. (e.g. any sufficiently obscure language)
              
                You are in a situation in which even looking up which methods are available is hard, often due to a
                bespoke build process that confuses the editor. (e.g. basically any build or runtime generation of code,
                or bespoke loading/selection of libraries).
              
              In either case, great editor/LSP support is more or less considered mandatory for modern programming
              languages. And of course, this is where pipelining shines.
            
              Ask any IDE, autocompleting fizz.bu... -> fizz.buzz() is  than
              autocompleting , for the obvious reason that you
              didn’t even write  in the second example yet, so your editor has less
              information to work with.
            
              Pipelining is  at data processing, and allows you to transform code that’s commonly
              written with ‘inside-out’ control flow into ’line-by-line’ transformations.
            
              Where could this possibly be more clear than in SQL, the presumably single most significant language for
              querying and aggregating complex large-scale datasets?
            
              You’ll be pleased to hear that, yes, people are in fact working on bringing pipelining to SQL. (Whether
              it’s actually going to happen in this specific form
              is a different question,
              let’s not get too carried away here.)
            
              Unless you’re one of those people who spends so much time dealing with SQL that it’s become second nature,
              and the thought that the control flow of nested queries is hard to follow for the average non-database
              engineer is incomprehensible to you, I guess.
            I’ll put their example of how a standard nested query can be simplified here, for convenience:Versus the SQL Syntax she told you not to worry about:
              Less nesting. More aligned with other languages and
              LINQ. Can easily be
              read line-by-line.
            
              Here’s a more
              skeptical voice (warning, LinkedIn!). Franck Pachot raises the great point that the  statement at the top of a query is
              (essentially) its function signature and specifies the return type. With pipe syntax, you lose some of
              this readability.
            I agree, but that seems like a solvable problem to me.
              And—surprise, surprise—it fits pretty well into pipelining. Any situation where you need to construct a
              complex, stateful object (e.g. a client or runtime), it’s a great way to feed complex, optional arguments
              into an object.
            
              Some people say they prefer optional/named arguments, but honestly, I don’t understand why: An optional
              named  parameter is harder to track down in code (and harder to mark as deprecated!) than
              all instances of a  builder function.
            
              If you have no clue what I’m talking about, this here is the type of pattern I’m talking about. You have a
              ‘builder’ object, call some methods on it to configure it, and finally  the object
              you’re actually interested in.
            Making Haskell (slightly more) readable
              It has these weird operators like , , , or
               and when you ask Haskell programmers about what they mean, they say something like
              “Oh, this is just a special case of the generalized
              Kleisli Monad Operator in the category of endo-pro-applicatives over a locally small poset.” and your eyes
              have glazed over before they’ve even finished the sentence.
            (It also doesn’t help that Haskell allows you to define custom operators however you please, yes.)
              If you’re wondering “How could a language have so many bespoke operators?”, my understanding is that most
              of them are just fancy ways of telling Haskell to compose some functions in a highly advanced way. Here’s
              the second-most basic
              example, the  operator.
            
              Imagine you have functions , , and some value . In a
              “““normal””” language you might write . In Haskell, this is written as
              . This is since  will automatically ‘grab’ values to the right as its
              arguments, so you don’t need the parentheses.
            
              A consequence of this is that  is written as  in
              Haskell. If you wrote , the compiler will interpret it as
              , which would be wrong. This is what people mean when they say that Haskell’s
              function call syntax is
              left-associative.
            
              The  operator is nothing but syntactic sugar that allows you to write
               instead of having to write . That’s it. People were
              fed-up with having to put parens everywhere, I guess.
            If your eyes glazed over at this point, I can’t blame you.
              Talking about any of the fancier operators would be punching well above my weight-class, so I’ll just
              stick to what I’ve been saying throughout this entire post already. Here’s a stilted Haskell toy example,
              intentionally not written in
              pointfree style.
            
              If you want to figure out the flow of data, this whole function body has to be read
              .
            
              To make things even funnier, you need to start with the  clause to figure out which
              local “variables” are being defined. This happens (for whatever reason) at the end of the function instead
              of at the start. (Calling  a variable is misleading, but that’s besides the
              point.)
            
              At this point you might wonder if Haskell has some sort of pipelining operator, and yes, it turns out that
              one was
              added in 2014! That’s pretty late considering that Haskell exists since 1990. This allows us to refactor the above
              code as follows:
            Isn’t that way easier to read? is code which you can show to an enterprise Java programmer, tell them that they’re looking
              at
              Java Streams
              with slightly weird syntax, and they’ll get the idea.
            
              Of course, in reality nothing is as simple. The Haskell ecosystem seems to be split between users of
              , users of , and users of the
              Flow-provided operators, which allow the same functionality, but allow you to write
               instead of .
              I don’t know what to say about that, other than that—not entirely unlike C++—Haskell has its own share of
              operator-related and cultural historical baggage, and a split ecosystem, and this makes the language
              significantly less approachable than it has to be.
            Rust’s pipelining is pretty neat
              In the beginning I said that ‘Pipelining is the feature that allows you to omit a single argument from
              your parameter list, by instead passing the previous value.’
            
              I still think that this is true, but it doesn’t get across the whole picture. If you’ve paid attention in
              the previous sections, you’ll have noticed that  and
               share basically  in common outside of the order of
              operations.
            
              In the first case, we’re accessing a value that’s  to the object. In the second, we’re
              ‘just’ passing an expression to a free-standing function.
            
              Or in other words, pipelining is not the same as pipelining. Even from an IDE-perspective, they’re
              different. In Java, your editor will look for methods associated with an object and walk up the
              inheritance chain. In Haskell, your editor will put a so-called
              ’typed hole’, and try to deduce which functions have a type that ‘fits’ into the hole using
              Hindley-Milner Type Inference.
            
              Personally, I like type inference (and
              type classes), but I also like if
              types have a namespace attached to them, with methods and associated functions. I am pragmatic like that.
            
              What I like about Rust is that it gives me the best out of both worlds here: You get traits and type
              inference without needing to wrap your head around a fully functional, immutable, lazy, monad-driven
              programming paradigm, and you get methods and associated values without the absolute dumpster fire of
              complex inheritance chains or AbstractBeanFactoryConstructors.
            
              I’ve not seen any other language that even comes close to the convenience of Rust’s pipelines, and its
              lack of higher-kinded types or inheritance did not stop it. Quite the opposite, if anything.
            
              I like pipelining. That’s the one thing that definitely should be obvious if you’ve read all the way
              through this article.
            I just think they’re neat, y’know?I like reading my code top-to-bottom, left-to-right instead of from-the-inside-to-the-outside.
              I like when I don’t need to count arguments and parentheses to figure out which value is the first
              argument of the second function, and which is the second argument of the first function.
            
              I like when my editor can show me all fields of a struct, and all methods or functions associated with a
              value, just when I press  on my keyboard. It’s great.
            
              I like when  and the  layer of the code repository don’t look like
              complete ass.
            
              I like when adding a function call in the middle of a process doesn’t require me to parse the whole line
              to add the closing parenthesis, and doesn’t require me to adjust the nesting of the whole block.
            
              I like when my functions distinguish between ‘a main value which we are acting upon’ and ‘secondary
              arguments’, as opposed to treating them all as the same.
            
              I like when I don’t have to pollute my namespaces with a ton of helper variables or free-standing
              functions that I had to pull in from somewhere.
            
              If you’re writing pipelined code—and not trying overly hard to fit everything into a single, convoluted,
              nested pipeline—then your functions will naturally split up into a few pipeline chunks.
            
              Each chunk starts with a piece of ‘main data’ that travels on a conveyer belt, where every line performs
              exactly one action to transform it. Finally, a single value comes out at the end and gets its own name, so
              that it may be used later.
            
              And that is—in my humble opinion—exactly how it should be. Neat, convenient, separated ‘chunks’, each of
              which can easily be understood in its own right.

It was painted with Xiamen livery.The jet, which made refuelling stops in Guam and Hawaii on its 5,000-mile (8,000-km) return journey, was one of several 737 MAX jets – Boeing’s bestselling model – that had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre for final work and delivery.Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. In retaliation, China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods.A Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet could be crippled by the tariffs, given that a new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55m, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. Beijing is reportedly considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.Last week it was reported that China’s government had asked Chinese airlines to pause purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies like Boeing. China holds about 20% of the expected global demand for aircraft over the next two decades.Boeing’s order book had 130 planes scheduled for deliver to Chinese companies at the end of March for both commercial airlines and leasing firms, Airways Mag reported.It was not clear which party made the decision for the aircraft to return to the US. Boeing and Xiamen had not responded to Reuters requests for comment at time of publication.Just hours before Trump detailed his so-called “liberation day” tariffs, Boeing chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, told a US Senate hearing that the company sold about 80% of its planes overseas and wanted to avoid getting into a situation where “certain markets become closed to us”.Ortberg said there was about half a trillion dollars in backlogged orders at the time.Michael O’Leary, the group chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, told the Financial Times last week that the company was due to receive 25 Boeing aircraft from August but “we might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China to sanction US Congress members and others who ‘acted egregiously’ on Hong Kong</title><link>https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307291/china-sanctions-us-congress-members-officials-and-others-who-behaved-badly-hong-kong?module=top_story&amp;amp;pgtype=homepage</link><author>/u/Saltedline</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:45:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[China will apply tit-for-tat sanctions on US Congress members, officials and heads of non-governmental organisations that Beijing deems to have “acted egregiously” on -related issues.Foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun described the US sanctions as a “severe interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s internal affairs”.

The arrival of the internet introduced the concept of cloud computing, transforming how businesses store, manage, and process data by enabling access to computing resources over the internet. Traditional cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud operate on a centralized model. These services rely on large data centers owned and managed by a single entity, with inherent barriers (challenges) like security vulnerabilities, censorship, and less control over data.Traditional Cloud BarriersCentralized cloud models, with their innovation, are vulnerable to single points of failure, where a data center outage can disrupt all users. They also raise significant concerns about data privacy and security, as users must trust the provider with sensitive information. Additionally, businesses often face vendor lock-in, making it costly and complex to switch providers due to compatibility issues and data migration challenges. With the emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized cloud emerges as a viable alternative for cloud computing and storage that sets businesses free from barriers.\
Decentralized cloud computing differs by distributing computational resources, data storage, and services across multiple decentralized nodes, often powered by blockchain technology. This approach creates a more secure, transparent, and user-centric infrastructure that addresses the drawbacks of traditional cloud (centralized models).Decentralized cloud leverages on peer-to-peer networks to enhance resilience, privacy, and cost effectiveness, to offer a promising edge for businesses seeking greater control over their data.Why Decentralized Cloud: The AdvantagesResearch shows that decentralized cloud computing offers several advantages over traditional cloud services, making it a better option for businesses and individuals. And here is the detailed breakdown of these benefits.\
Enhanced Security and Privacy: Decentralized clouds distribute data across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches. Each piece of data is encrypted and stored in different locations, making it harder for attackers to access the datasets. Moreover, users retain control over their data, as they can encrypt it before it leaves their device, ensuring privacy. For example, platforms like Aleph Cloud implement client-side encryption, mitigating risks associated with centralized storage vulnerabilities such as malware and man-in-the-middle attacks.\
Resilience and Reliability: With no single point of failure, decentralized clouds are more resilient to outages and cyber attacks. If one node goes down, the network continues to function using other nodes, which ensures uninterrupted service. This resilience is particularly valuable for businesses reliant on continuous operations.\
 Decentralized clouds are more affordable and efficient, especially for smaller businesses. By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, businesses can use underutilized computing resources from other participants, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure. For instance, smaller companies often find centralized cloud fees, like AWS's $23 monthly charge for data center storage, as burdensome, whereas decentralized cloud providers like Aleph Cloud offer a more democratic pricing model.\
Scalability and Flexibility: Decentralized clouds scale more easily by adding more nodes to the network, accommodating fluctuating demand without the constraints of centralized infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial for applications with variable workloads, such as AI and machine learning, in comparison with centralized models.\
 With a decentralized cloud, individual users can monetize their computing resources by becoming node operators, creating a more inclusive ecosystem. This democratization allows individuals to earn rewards for contributing resources and promoting a community-driven approach.\
These advantages position decentralized cloud computing as a compelling alternative, particularly for businesses seeking to mitigate the risks and barriers associated with centralized cloud. Several projects are already at the forefront of decentralized cloud, demonstrating its practical applications and benefits. Among them is Aleph Cloud, offering decentralized compute and storage solutions that address the limitations of centralized cloud barriers.Understanding Aleph Cloud: The Web3 SupercloudAleph Cloud is a decentralized cloud platform that provides on-demand serverless computation, database, and storage infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Aleph Cloud leverages a two-layered architecture, comprising Core Channel Nodes (CCNs) and Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs). CCNs ensure security, process transactions, store data, and enable cross-chain communication, while CRNs provide computational power and data storage to ensure efficient task distribution. Unlike others that focus on static storage, Aleph Cloud handles data that needs real-time updates, making it ideal for dynamic applications. Aleph Cloud supercloud currently supports 24 chains for builders to seamlessly leverage Aleph Cloud innovation.:::info
Aleph Cloud is like a decentralized AWS for Web3, which provides serverless computing, dynamic storage, and databases through a network of nodes rather than one company's servers.Aleph Cloud Key features: Real World UsageAleph Cloud powers dynamic NFT metadata for blockchain-based games, notably through a partnership with Ubisoft. Since 2021, Ubisoft has run a Core Channel Node on Aleph Cloud to manage NFT metadata for games like Champions Tactics and Captain Laserhawk. This ensures secure, tamper-proof data for in-game assets, letting players mint, trade, or sell items with unique traits. Aleph Cloud Verifiable Random Function (VRF) adds fairness by generating transparent randomness for gameplay, addressing centralized cloud risks of data manipulation or outages.\
Decentralized Identity (DID)Aleph Cloud works with Synaps and Anima protocol to offer secure, self-sovereign identity management. Users can control their personal data like KYC metadata, without relying on centralized databases, which reduces data breach risks. This is a major advancement for industries like finance and healthcare, where privacy is critical, and it frees businesses from the costs and vulnerabilities of centralized storage.\
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)Aleph Cloud supports DeFi apps by providing resilient storage and computing for order books, transaction data, and real-time processing computation. Aleph distributed indexing lets DeFi platforms on high-throughput chains like Solana query on-chain data efficiently, avoiding the single points of failure common in centralized clouds like AWS, for DeFi projects to stay true to decentralization while scaling operations.Aleph Cloud's scalable computing and dynamic storage are perfect for AI-driven projects with real-time updates. It supports startups and enterprises building AI agents or large-scale models, offering confidential virtual machines (VMs) with AMD SEV encryption for secure processing. For instance, Aleph Cloud integration with Libertai.io allows AI models to run on a decentralized network, ensuring privacy and resilience.\
Web Hosting and Content DeliveryAleph Cloud-powered TwentySix Cloud platform offers decentralized website hosting (static or dynamic) and content delivery networks (CDNs). By distributing content across nodes, it improves load times and reduces bottlenecks, unlike centralized CDNs that can falter under heavy traffic. Businesses can host apps or sites with less risk of downtime and lower costs.\
Aleph Cloud also supports decentralized social media platforms, where user data stays private; supply chain tracking, with secure, real-time data from sensors; and healthcare platforms, where encrypted medical records are shared securely. These use cases show its versatility, helping businesses avoid centralized clouds barriers.Aleph cloud provides confidential virtual machines (VMs) secured with AMD SEV encryption, for enhanced data privacy and security which is a critical concern for businesses dealing with sensitive information.:::tip
Businesses benefit from Aleph Cloud by reducing dependence on centralized providers, lowering costs, and gaining more control over their data.Conclusion: Future of Decentralized CloudDecentralized cloud computing represents a significant shift from traditional cloud services, for enhanced security, privacy, resilience, and cost effectiveness. Projects like Aleph Cloud are at the forefront of this innovation, providing businesses with alternatives that address the limitations of centralized infrastructure barriers and single points of failure. For example, Ubisoft's NFT platform avoids the risks of centralized storage, while DeFi apps scale without single points of failure. Aleph Cloud also allows Individuals to join as node operators, earning ALEPH tokens for sharing resources, for a community-driven ecosystem.\
By embracing decentralized solutions, businesses can not only overcome the drawbacks of centralized clouds but also contribute to a more resilient and democratic digital ecosystem. As the landscape evolves, the potential of decentralized cloud computing is already setting businesses free from the constraints of traditional models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Vice President Vance in India for talks amid tariffs, deportations | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ztx7wqOFA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/C-ztx7wqOFA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:20:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[JD Vance has arrived in Delhi, kicking off a four-day visit to the country.

A main source for downtime in customer environments occurred when image registries went down. The traditional way to solve this problem is to set up a stateful mirror, however we had to work within customer budget and time constraints which did not allow it. During a Black Friday, we started getting hit with a ton of traffic while GitHub container registries were down. This limited our ability to scale up the cluster as we depended on critical images from that registry. After this incident, I started thinking about a better way to avoid these scalability issues. A solution that did not need a stateful component and required minimal operational oversight. This is where the idea for Spegel came from.As a sole maintainer of an open source project, I was enthused when Microsoft reached out to set up a meeting to talk about Spegel. The meeting went well, and I felt there was going to be a path forward ripe with cooperation and hopefully a place where I could onboard new maintainers. I continued discussions with one of the Microsoft engineers, helping them get Spegel running and answering any architecture questions they had. At the time I was positive as I saw it as a possibility for Micorosft to contribute back changes based on their learnings. As time went on, silence ensued, and I assumed work priorities had changed.It was not until KubeCon Paris where I attended a talk that piqued my interest. The talk was about strategies to speed up image distribution where one strategy discussed was P2P sharing. The topics in the abstract sounded similar to Spegel so I was excited to hear other’s ideas about the problem. During the talk, I was enthralled seeing Spegel, my own project, be discussed as a P2P image sharing solution. When Peerd, a peer to peer distributor of container content in Kubernetes clusters made by Microsoft, was mentioned I quickly researched it. At the bottom of the README there was a thank you to myself and Spegel. This acknowledgement made it look like they had taken some inspiration from my project and gone ahead and developed a version of their own.While looking into Peerd, my enthusiasm for understanding different approaches in this problem space quickly diminished. I saw function signatures and comments that looked very familiar, as if I had written them myself. Digging deeper I found test cases referencing Spegel and my previous employer, test cases that have been taken directly from my project. References that are still present to this day. The project is a forked version of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft, but under Microsoft’s MIT license.Spegel was published with an MIT license. Software released under an MIT license allows for forking and modifications, without any requirement to contribute these changes back. I default to using the MIT license as it is simple and permissive. The license does not allow removing the original license and purport that the code was created by someone else. It looks as if large parts of the project were copied directly from Spegel without any mention of the original source. I have included a short snippet comparing the code which adds the mirror configuration where even the function comments are the same.A negative impact from the creation of Peerd is that it has created confusion among new users. I am frequently asked about the differences between Spegel and Peerd. As a maintainer, it is my duty to come across as unbiased and factual as possible, but this tumultuous history makes it challenging. Microsoft carries a large brand recognition, so it has been difficult for Spegel to try and take up space next to such a behemoth.As an open source maintainer I have dedicated ample time to community requests, bug fixes, and security fixes. In my conversation with Microsoft I was open to collaboration to continue building out a tool to benefit the open source community. Over the years I have contributed to a multitude of open source projects and created a few of my own. Spegel was the first project I created from the ground up that got some traction and seemed to be appreciated by the community. Seeing my project being forked by Microsoft made me feel like I was no longer useful. For a while I questioned if it was even worth continuing working on Spegel.Luckily, I persisted. Spegel still continues strong with over 1.7k stars and 14.4 million pulls since its first release over two years ago. However, I am not the first and unfortunately not the last person to come across this David versus Goliath-esque experience. How can sole maintainers work with multi-billion corporations without being taken advantage of? With the changes of Hashicorp licensing having a rippling effect through the open source community, along with the strong decline in investment in open source as a whole, how does the community prevail? As an effort to fund the work on Spegel I have enabled GitHub sponsors. This experience has also made me consider changing the license of Spegel, as it seems to be the only stone I can throw.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariff Wars &amp; Crypto Market: The Threats And Opportunities</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tariff-wars-and-crypto-market-the-threats-and-opportunities?source=rss</link><author>Ilia Ilinskii</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:38:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 2, 2025, President Trump declared a national emergency and introduced a slew of tariffs targeting almost every country in the world. Dubbed “Liberation Day,” Trump’s administration established a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with a massive tariff of up to 245% on some imports from China.\
In retaliation, China introduced its own measures that include curbs on the export of rare earth minerals and tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. Since the tariffs kicked off, trade between the biggest and second biggest economy in the world has slowed to a near stop, with both sides playing hardball.Impact On The Financial MarketsThere was an immediate reaction from the markets, with the S&P 500 down by double digits in the first few days. Since then, most of the financial markets have been trending downward as uncertainty regarding the tariff wars continues.\
On April 16, 2025, tensions escalated when the US introduced new restrictions on chip exports to China. Previously, NVIDIA had been allowed to export a powered-down version of its AI chips, called H20. However, under the new restrictions, exporting H20 chips will require a federal license, which is expected to cost NVIDIA over $5 billion in the current fiscal year.The Impact On The Crypto MarketsPresident Trump’s latest tariff war picks up from where it was in 2018 to 2019. When the recent tariffs were announced, Bitcoin immediately dipped to around $76K per coin. The reason for this is that during times of high uncertainty, investors tend to reduce their appetite for high-risk assets. Within a few days, over $200 billion was wiped off the global crypto market.\
However, crypto markets have proven to be much more resilient over the years and have not stayed down for long. By April 17, 2025, the price of Bitcoin had bounced back to just under $85K. Other major altcoins like Ethereum have also experienced a recovery, which lines up with the changing views on crypto, with some investors increasingly viewing it as a hedge against sudden changes in government policy.Apart from volatility, investors in the crypto market are also worried about stagflation, which is a combination of slow growth and increased inflation. The new tariffs could drive up prices, reversing gains by the Fed to cool down inflation. If the current tariff regime persists, US real GDP per capita could dip by almost 1%, according to Fitch Ratings.\
On April 4, 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the tariffs announced by Trump were bigger than the Fed had expected. As such, the impact on growth and inflation would need to be monitored closely. Investors have begun pricing in interest rate cuts in 2025, a reversal of previous tightening expectations. However, the Fed faces a tough balancing act. If it cuts rates too fast, it could fan inflation, and waiting too long could deepen a downturn.One notable aspect of the current trade wars is that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets fades after periods of stress. However, the short-term impact is high uncertainty. With the price of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market being determined by trade policy, analysts believe this could help purge the market of speculative pricing accumulated during the 2024 bull run.\
Analysts also believe that the ongoing turmoil could rekindle interest in DeFi, as traders look for alternatives to fiat systems at risk of disruption by geopolitical tensions.The crypto market is highly influenced by fear and greed, and currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is sitting at 30, which signals there is heightened fear amongst investors. This index, which is rated from 0 to 100, with 100 being extremely hopeful, and 0 being extreme fear.\
However, it is worth noting that towards the end of March, it briefly fell below 20, signalling extreme concern on tariffs. Its current level of 30 indicates that investors are claiming down. Despite the relative calm, interest in meme coins and altcoins has gone down significantly. As such, it means that in 2025, there might not be an altcoin season. Historically, Ethereum triggers the altcoin season. However, it is down 53% so far this year, and down 16% in the past month.\
Instead, the best opportunity this year is likely in Bitcoin, whose reputation as digital gold continues to gain traction. While there is still debate about Bitcoin’s long-term store of value, it appears to be holding up quite well amid the tariff wars compared to other top cryptos.Bitcoin As a Strategic AssetIf the trade wars do not cool down, it is possible that governments around the world could begin to eye Bitcoin as a strategic asset. While bigger countries like China can hold off the impact for months or possibly years, tiny countries may not have that luxury, forcing them to take unusual steps to achieve their economic goals.\
A good example is the proposed Bitcoin Reserve by Trump. The current proposal is that Bitcoin should be considered a strategic asset like oil or gold, and the government should have a stockpile of it. There have been proposals to pay down the US national debt of over $37 trillion using Bitcoin.\
Additionally, current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that stablecoins, which are pegged to the USD, could be used to attain certain monetary goals. Most stablecoins are backed by cash and short-term Treasury bills.Future Threats and Opportunities Amid TariffsAmid tariff wars, there are numerous threats and opportunities that exist for the crypto world. One of these is the potential strengthening of the US dollar. However, a subsequent end to such wars could reverse this gain. As such, investors might seek refuge in Bitcoin, which could act as a hedge against dollar value instability.\
Ongoing global de-dollarization is another important factor. Many countries, such as China, are not actively looking for alternatives to the USD. Additionally, the BRICS nations are working on an alternative currency to the dollar. In such a fragmented world, where the dollar is not the standard for international trade, Bitcoin could thrive. The use of BTC is often most prevalent where it is the only neutral option available. The current trade wars could trigger its fast adoption in this role.\
Another noteworthy consideration is potential panic. While the markets have remained calm, with hopes that deals could be reached soon, there is still the potential for panic if tariff wars persist. The tariff wars could erase $5 trillion in market valuation, flatten yields, and make traditional safe havens like gold less attractive. Such conditions could potentially lead investors to consider high-risk, high-reward alternatives like Bitcoin.\
The tariff wars could also expose some inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities in global institutions. They could trigger debt defaults and erode trust in the global fiat system. In such a scenario, Bitcoin would fit in perfectly since it is the exact purpose for which it was designed.The ongoing tariff wars and border geopolitical tensions present both threats and opportunities for the crypto market. These tariff wars have brought the role of Bitcoin in the global financial sector into sharp focus, including forecasts on how leading crypto projects could perform in the long term.\
Currently, the crypto market is bearish, driven by fear, with the price of Bitcoin still below its all-time high of over $100K. However, despite the ongoing uncertainty, one point that is clear is that while Bitcoin is not a guaranteed investment, it is one of the best assets to have if the ongoing tariff wars turn into an all-out global trade war. \n ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A visitor to the Vatican reacts to the passing of Pope Francis | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zrSv3DgRUc</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6zrSv3DgRUc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:36:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis has died, after presiding over the Catholic Church for more than a decade.

I bring more than a decade of technical expertise and an inherent love for building products at scale. From building full-stack solutions using the latest technologies — React, Node.js, GraphQL, Microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes — to delivering critical products for Fortune 500 companies, I thrive on problem-solving and teamwork. I’ve successfully led cross-functional projects & teams to propel startups and established firms across telecommunications, subscription commerce, and enterprise planning product lines. This unique mix of hands-on engineering,  leadership, and mentorship makes me well-suited to provide thought leadership on the future of technology and its impact on business.How Did You Start Writing?I actually discovered writing almost by accident while working as a frontend engineer on Twilio’s Phone Numbers team. We were rolling out a new feature, and I kept looking for answers at multiple places. One afternoon, I grabbed a blank doc and sketched a step‑by‑step guide for myself. Suddenly, I could see how writing forced me to clarify complex flows and helped me look for answers to the same questions again and again.\
Soon, I drafted more documents on the systems and technologies I was working. I realized writing wasn’t just a supplement to calls—it was my way to scale impact, reach dozens at once, and leave a lasting reference.How Has Technology Impacted The Way You Write?Technology has completely changed my writing by enhancing every phase. I typically use any of the new AI tools to create a high‑level outline of the topic, and then I add my own thoughts and insights. Once I have an initial draft, I use Grammarly to fix any issues related to grammar, clarity, and flow. This mix of AI-assisted brainstorming and debugging ensures authenticity while making sure the content is error-free and engaging, allowing me to focus on creativity.Share About Your Journey Highlights?In the last year, I have written more than 10 moderated articles across multiple forums, and each one of those articles has taught me something new. My proudest moment came the day when one of my articles was featured on the HackerNoon homepage, that was a big W. After a few days, I was named as a Top 10 Cloud Writer.\
My low was when one of the initial days when I had a lot of thoughts about a particular topic, but it took me a really long time to put them coherently into an article. Those early times of battling writer’s block were quite disappointing. They taught me that I gotta slow down, organize my thoughts, be consistent, and keep writing!What’s Your Creative Process?Most of my writing inspiration comes from the problems I faced at work or a new technology I have been learning on the side. First, I write down the main points in my Notion workspace, then I do some research to fill any gaps. Once I feel I have a good understanding, I write a rough draft, add some code snippets, my personal opinion, and learnings. I typically go through a draft 3-4 times to refine it before I submit it for review.Your Favorite Memory/Article(s) to This Day?How Did You Hear About HackerNoon? Share With Us About Your Experience With HackerNoon.I first discovered Hackernoon about 6-7 years ago, and I have been an avid reader since then. I was amazed when I found a range of people from veteran CTOs to individual contributors sharing practical, hands-on, valuable insights on a wide range of topics. Inspired by this, I decided to jump on this bandwagon myself, and I have loved every aspect of being a writer. The editors have been incredibly supportive. They have kept me motivated, helped me immensely to refine my voice, and constantly get better.What Have You Learnt From Your Journey?I have learnt that writing is not just about telling but also about listening. It’s not about sharing technology, concepts, but also having clarity of thought, empathy, and insight for the reader. It’s very important to spend time doing due diligence, researching to turn vague ideas into a structured, meaningful story. Besides this, Iteration is very important; each revision made my article better than the last time, strengthening my message. Writing has also taught me patience, the power of being consistent & learning, it’s made me a much better, more empathetic engineer and communicator.“The scariest moment is always just before you start.” —Stephen King\
Writing for HackerNoon has satisfied my appetite to learn, create, and connect with an inspiring community. Every article has challenged me to build, iterate, and share authentic insights. I am very grateful for the support, my personal growth - looking forward to new discoveries and new articles ahead.Check out Mohit Menghnani’s HackerNoon profile here, and read more of his amazing stories!:::info

This app lets compatible Android devices run a full-fledged instance of the popular Debian distro in a virtual machine, opening the door to running popular Linux desktop programs alongside Android apps. However, the feature isn’t quite ready for everyday professional use, currently lacking support for critical features like graphical apps and audio output, and until recently, it was restricted to just 16GB of storage space, limiting the Linux VM’s capacity for apps and files. Thankfully, Google just lifted that storage limitation, allowing the Linux Terminal to use as much of your phone’s storage as needed.
You’re reading an  story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won’t find anywhere else.With the release of the fourth Android 16 beta, Google has uncapped the disk resize slider in the Linux Terminal app’s settings. In previous releases, the disk size was capped at 16GB. In Android 16 Beta 4, however, the disk can be resized to occupy most of the host device’s remaining storage, leaving 1GB free to prevent the virtual machine from consuming all available space.I tested this feature on a Google Pixel 9 Pro running Android 16 Beta 4, successfully resizing the Linux disk to 42.3GB. The process took only a few seconds, and after restarting the VM, the increased storage was immediately available. According to Android’s storage settings, the total size consumed by the Linux Terminal app (including the base app and the resized VM disk) grew to approximately 45.52GB.In a future release, Google plans to remove the disk resize slider entirely from the Linux Terminal app. Instead, the app will employ storage ballooning to dynamically adjust the storage space available to the Debian VM. This feature allows the guest VM’s storage to “inflate” to use available space and “deflate” when the host system needs to reclaim it. This approach offers two key benefits: the storage allocated to Debian doesn’t need to be fixed upfront, and it protects the host from running out of space by automatically shrinking the guest’s available storage when necessary.Google is rapidly improving the Linux Terminal app, recognizing its key role in the company’s plans to transition Chrome OS to an Android base. Although the app theoretically allows for running full-fledged Linux desktop environments, Google says the Terminal’s primary purpose is to enable running Linux apps alongside Android apps, not to replace Android’s native desktop mode.

Viktor Orbán, the central European country’s prime minister, has been a guest at the president’s Mar-a-Lago estate and has won Trump’s praise for transforming Hungary into an “illiberal state” that extols “traditional” values – and for projecting the kind of “strongman” persona the president admires.Yet the contrasting political fate of one of Hungary’s near-neighbours with similar historical antecedents may provide a glimmer of hope for the prospects of mass protest laying foundations for a successful onslaught against Trump, leading to victory at the ballot box.The Czech Republic – once part of what was cold war-era Czechoslovakia and, coincidentally, birthplace of Trump’s first wife, Ivana – is a possible blueprint for how street protest can bloom into a unified electoral strategy that eventually unseats a billionaire leader with autocratic aspirations and apparent scorn for democracy.In 2018, a popular movement, Million Moments for Democracy, began organizing rallies in the Czech capital, Prague, and other cities to protest the anti-democratic tendencies of the country’s prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who had been labelled “the Czech Trump”.Babiš, a billionaire oligarch who was the country’s second-richest person, had taken office as head of a coalition that relied on support from the remnants of the Czech communist party after his populist ANO (Action for Dissatisfied Citizens) party won the previous year’s election.An even greater number turned up in November 2019, ostensibly to mark the 30th anniversary of communism’s collapse – which had itself been triggered by mass protests. The prime minister stood firm, and as the Covid-19 virus forced the country into prolonged lockdown, protests diminished and Babiš’s position seemed more assured, despite widespread discontent over his handling of the pandemic.Yet in 2021 parliamentary elections, Babiš and his lavishly funded party were defeated by a five-party coalition whose ideological differences were superseded by their hostility toward the prime minister.The demonstrations, despite the lost momentum caused by Covid and Babiš’s stubborn refusal to resign even as police lodged criminal fraud charges, had worked by converting discontent into votes at the ballot box.“We certainly had some role in the election results,” said Benjamin Roll, Million Moments for Democracy’s spokesperson and deputy leader at the time. “I believe we in the Czech Republic are an example of how long-term civic-society activities can bring, or help bring, political change.“Those protests gave us all the feeling we have the power, that we were not alone, and we can do something. I think this emotion is really crucial.”It is a potentially decisive factor amid swirling debate about how to respond to Trump as he has smashed long-established norms and assailed institutions at breakneck speed since his inauguration on 20 January.While the leftwing Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York representative, have attracted vast crowds on their Fighting Oligarchy road tour that seems to emphasize the value of popular dissent, other Democrats have adopted a less confrontational approach, with some opting not to fight Trump at every turn.The party’s leader in the senate, Chuck Schumer, drew fire from many on his own side for leading a group of fellow Democratic senators in voting for a six-month Republican funding bill last month, averting a government shutdown.The move sharpened criticism that congressional Democrats had reacted too passively to Trump’s authoritarian power grabs.At the same time, the party’s exclusion from power in the White House and on Capitol Hill has prompted questions over the effectiveness of mass protests. The failure of demonstrations to translate into electoral defeat for authoritarian-type leaders in some countries – Hungary, Turkey and Serbia are recently cited examples – has fed such doubts.However, Steven Levitsky, a politics professor at Harvard University and a specialist on authoritarian threats to democracy, said dismissing mass rallies as futile – which he called “a new conventional wisdom” after years of thinking they guaranteed a dictator’s downfall – was misplaced.“Mass protest is less likely to bring down a government in a place where elections are a viable channel, meaning where it is still a democracy or near-democracy,” he said. “Protest is not going to lead to Donald Trump’s resignation, or Orbán’s, but that doesn’t mean it’s not relevant. Protest can weaken the government, can shape public opinion and the media framing and discourse, which is very important.”At the “Hands Off” rally in Washington DC on 5 April, which drew tens of thousands of people, participants said one aim was to embolden reticent voters and Trump critics who might be intimidated by the president’s blustering tactics.Jiří Pehe, a Czech political analyst who is the director of New York University in Prague, said that message had its echoes in the Czech precedent.“It was this overall, this strategy of waking people up and telling them: ‘Look, you have agency. You can change things. You are not just passive observers of what’s going on, but you can change things, but you have to be active,’” he said.But allowing millions of dissatisfied Americans simply to vent their frustrations would not be enough, Pehe warned. “If the Czech Republic is to be an example, these demonstrations need to happen again and again across the United States and they need to have one or two strong messages. There has to be a very strong message towards the political class because only it can actually change things. And in this case, there should be pressure on the Democrats, saying: ‘Look, it’s your task to stop Donald Trump.’”Speaking to the Guardian at the 5 April Washington rally, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top member of the House judiciary committee, said “a popular resistance strategy” featuring protests could only work in harness with “an effective legislative strategy”, a tall order since the Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.“Ultimately, we’re going to have to win the elections next year, and when we take back the House and the Senate, we will be back in the driver’s seat,” he said.That aim evokes another lesson from the Czech example, observers say: the need for the Democrats to take their cue from the demonstrators and put aside their ideological differences for the sake of unity.“What you’ve seen in the Czech Republic is a broad array of political forces coming together to form a pro-democracy coalition and I think that’s instructive for the US,” said Norm Eisen, a former US ambassador to Prague and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who called for a “big tent” approach encompassing anti-Trump Republicans.“They were for putting aside particular differences on partisan issues, on ideology. That is one of the critical ingredients for success, and I believe we are seeing that here. In these deportation disputes, we filed a brief at the supreme court by more than three dozen conservatives, [who served in] every Republican presidential administration, from Nixon to Trump 1, and I was the lawyer on that, together with a senior justice department official from the Bush administration.”Levitsky said the US protests had assumed outsize importance given the failure of other institutions and pillars of the establishment – including major CEOs, law firms, the Catholic church and, until this week, universities – to mount a stand since Trump took office.“This emerging protest movement, and the size of the crowds at the Bernie Sanders and AOC events, is going to compel Democratic politicians to become more active, follow their base rather than so as not to lose it,” he said. “What the protest movement can do is contribute to an erosion of Trump’s popularity, and embolden opposition politicians and probably contribute to an electoral outcome in a couple years.“In that sense, these guys are not wasting their time. I think it’s a very, very important step in getting the opposition off the sidelines.”Back in Prague, Roll – recalling the intoxication of the anti-Babiš rallies – had advice for US demonstrators: stay positive and, whatever Trump’s provocations, avoid hateful rhetoric – something he fears the US’s two-party system makes hard to avoid.“The division in the United States is really dangerous because you see the other side as the enemy,” he said. “It’s crucial to remain non-violent and hopeful. Talking in front of lots of people, we realised you have to be careful about your language because if you are too negative or hateful, it can defeat your purpose. Remember that the other side are people. They’re your brothers and sisters.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is The 2025 Cryptocurrency Bull Market Over Already?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/is-the-2025-cryptocurrency-bull-market-over-already?source=rss</link><author>Dmytro Spilka</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market was supposed to be going from strength to strength in Q1 2025, buoyed by Bitcoin’s natural halving cycle and the long-awaited arrival of a pro-crypto President in Donald Trump. Instead, the industry has declined steadily as investors become wary of macroeconomic constraints and scams.\
Trump’s resounding election victory had emboldened crypto enthusiasts. There were also some  since the President re-entered the White House which indicated that their ambitions for the industry could finally be realized.\
The repeal of an accounting rule by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and an executive order by Trump focusing on directing a working group to study and propose changes to crypto regulations along with the possible formation of a strategic government reserve of cryptocurrencies within 180 days would be music to the ears of investors.\
Upon Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024, the total global cryptocurrency market capitalization rallied from $2.26 trillion on election night to a peak of $3.72 trillion by December 17. However, just two months on, we’ve seen the total crypto market cap recede  in an unexpected contraction.\
Despite the President’s crypto-friendly outlook, it’s possible that the early days of Trump 2.0 are playing a role in undermining the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem at a time when Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow (S2F) model has forecasted a post-halving bull run.\
“There are concerns about how Trump's policies could affect cryptocurrency markets in the long term,” suggests Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24. “His administration's approach to taxation and regulation could introduce uncertainty that could scare off some investors.”\
“In addition, any significant market corrections or increased volatility could lead to a reassessment of risk among cryptocurrency investors. Therefore, while the near-term outlook may remain positive, the sustainability of this bullish trend will depend on specific regulatory changes, Fed policy, and broader economic conditions.”Presidential Memecoins Undermine TrustOne of the more unexpected trends of crypto in 2025 so far has revolved around the launch of memecoins backed by multiple Presidential figures. In Argentina, President Javier Milei has risked impeachment by backing the launch of the $LIBRA coin.\
Following a  on social media platform X, the coin rallied in value before Milei decided to delete the post causing a collapse that saw many lose out on their investment.\
But it was the launch of $TRUMP that caused the biggest stir in the crypto memecoin space in 2025. The official Presidential token, which was soon followed by the launch of $MELANIA, the official token of the First Lady, drew accusations of a cash grab, due to the President’s team controlling at least .\
At the time of writing, $TRUMP has sunk 77% from its peak value, while $MELANIA is more than 90% below its all-time high.\
The Trump administration has denied any wrongdoing with the launch of official Presidential memecoins, and maintains that purchasing the token is merely a show of support to the President and First Lady, rather than an investment opportunity.\
Recently, it was announced that anybody who bought official Trump products before February 15, 2025, would be able to claim three free $TRUMP tokens, opening the door to a prospective loyalty scheme associated with the coin.\
However, it’s been the proliferation of memecoins that has risked undermining the wider crypto landscape’s momentum in recent weeks. The launch of $TRUMP prompted an  posing as the official memecoin, damaging trust in the ecosystem in the process.\
Following the high-profile collapse of the $HAWK memecoin promoted by influencer Haliey Welch in December, crypto pump-and-dump schemes have been a key concern for investors, and there’s a danger that meme investing is damaging the liquidity of the market in its entirety.\
Worryingly, the value of Bitcoin, the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency has slid more than 8% back below $100,000 in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. But there have been many different factors at play in driving the price of BTC lower.Macroeconomics Push Bitcoin LowerThere have been many reasons behind Bitcoin’s poor performance during the early stages of Trump 2.0.\
One major factor has stemmed from Wall Street , the generative AI platform that overtook ChatGPT as the most downloaded app.\
With the Chinese firm illustrating that the AI boom isn’t isolated to Wall Street, markets became fearful of overvaluations domestically.\
Because the cryptocurrency market correlates with Wall Street, the market became more volatile as a result.\
Trump’s tariffs have also contributed to more volatility throughout the cryptocurrency landscape, with many global risk assets impacted by the uncertainty brought by the impact on trade.\
It may be that the impact of these macroeconomic pressures is pushing crypto lower in the short term, but could help Bitcoin to return to its cyclical rally in the months ahead.Could Skies be Set to Clear?Despite the impact of $TRUMP on the cryptocurrency landscape becoming the subject of much debate, the Trump administration continues to explore new projects within the ecosystem.\
The recent announcement by the Trump-backed venture World Liberty Financial that it would launch a strategic token reserve designed to boost the crypto market, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been a timely piece of good news to provide a boost to investors.\
Dubbed the ‘Macro Strategy’, the initiative could lead to a reserve that maintains a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) as a means of improving the quality of financial services offered throughout the fintech market.\
Another source of optimism stems from the announcement of the ‘DOGE Dividend’, which the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, suggested could come in the form of a $5,000 cheque sent to US taxpayers using the savings made by his department in 2026.\
This payout could provide a widespread cryptocurrency market boost akin to the rollout of government stimulus packages amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Is This The End of Bitcoin’s Cycles?The cryptocurrency landscape has historically relied on Bitcoin’s halving cycle to chart out the coin’s market rallies. As the only metric that produced a consistent trend in a market that’s filled with volatility, Bitcoin’s cycles have been an excellent investment tool.\
However, the return of Donald Trump has seen an unprecedented level of attention fall on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. As a result, we’re seeing investor sentiment driven by many factors that fall outside of Bitcoin’s cycles.\
If Trump can continue to propel crypto further into the limelight then it’s likely to be bullish for the industry as a whole. But without the reliability of Bitcoin’s cycles, investors may need to find new ways to map out future bull runs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis Dies: His Unique Approach to Leading the Catholic Church | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMfh0b4nsOE</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PMfh0b4nsOE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 08:50:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis was known for refocusing the Catholic Church on promoting social and economic justice rather than traditional moral teachings.

You’ve seen this battle in your projects.Object-Relational MappersStill, those databases didn’t give us the consistency guarantees we were comfortable with, like transactions, isolation levels, etc. PostgreSQL added the JSONB column type to answer the question: Then other databases like MySQL and SQLite followed.Let’s discuss today how it works, and if it’s the actual answer.First, terminology: the B in JSON stands for BinaryJSON stores data as text,JSONB uses a binary representationThe binary format of JSONB enables efficient indexing and querying and eliminates the need for repeated parsing. You can think of a JSONB column as a table inside the column. Each path to property can be seen logically as a different column.To visualise this conceptual model, imagine if our database could access any path directly without scanning the entire document:+----+---------------+--------------------------+--------------------+
| id | customer.name | customer.contact.address | email              |
+----+---------------+--------------------------+--------------------+
| 1  | "John Smith"  | "Portland"               | "john@example.com" | 
+----+---------------+--------------------------+--------------------+ Of course, that’s a bit of an oversimplification. PostgreSQL doesn't create these virtual columns, but the binary representation effectively allows it to access paths directly without scanning the whole document. This approach provides several benefits:Path traversal is much faster than parsing textFields can be indexed individuallyQuery performance is more predictableWhen Postgresql stores a JSONB document, it doesn't simply dump JSON text into a field. It transforms the document into a binary representation.Have a look on the following JSON:This hierarchical structure could be flattened into a set of paths for each nested structure:Path: customer.name = "John Smith"
Path: customer.contact.email = "john@example.com"
Path: customer.contact.phone = "555-1234"
Path: customer.contact.address.city = "Portland"
Path: customer.contact.address.country = "USA"
The goal is: to performantly read a specific field without parsing the entire document.JSONB's document is stored as a hierarchical, tree-like structure of key-value pairs, each containing metadata about its type and actual data.When new JSON is stored, it has to be parsed and converted from text to key-value pairs. This conversion happens through a process called "tokenisationFor example, using our customer data example:{
  "id": "cust_web_123",
  "email": "web_user@example.com",
  "source": "website",
  "web_data": {
    "first_visit": "2023-03-12T15:22:47Z",
    "utm_source": "google_search"
  },
  "contact": {
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  }
}
Would be tokenised and stored with internal tree-like structures tracking:Value: Object {
      Count: 1,
      Children: [Of course, it’s a bit simplified form, but you can think that each array element is actually a different node, and the index in the array is just a nested path.PostgreSQL's JSONB tokenisation is sneaky. It not only parses data but also preserves the actual data types of values.ensure that data maintains its semantic meaning,enable type-specific operations (like numeric comparisons),avoid type conversion when not needed.What’s more, it’s not limited to JSON types.customer_data->'customer'->'contact'->'address'->>'city'PostgreSQL can navigate directly to that specific token  without scanning the entire document. It uses the described hierarchical structure, and gets the exact value with the type.When PostgreSQL encounters such query, it:Parses the path into individual segments.Locates the root object or array in the binary structure.Each path segment computes a hash of the key.Uses the hash to look up the corresponding entry in the structure.Navigates to the next level if needed.Extracts and returns the value in the requested format.This algorithm is heavily optimised for typical access patterns. For simple path expressions, PostgreSQL can retrieve values with near-constant time complexity, regardless of document size. However, the performance characteristics become more variable for more complex expressions, especially those involving arrays or filtering.Understanding this internal path representation explains why some JSONB queries perform better than others.To see how JSONB actually works, let's discuss a scenario that manages customer data.Here's how a typical customer model might look in TypeScript:// Different structure depending on acquisition channel
  // At least one of these will be present per customerIf you tried to model it with relational tables, you'd face a classic data modelling challenge. You'd end up with either:A complex set of tables with joins:A wide table with mostly NULL values:With JSONB, you can implement this in PostgreSQL without forcing every customer profile into the same rigid structure:This allows storing profiles with wildly different shapes while keeping common fields queryable. The SQL implementation might look like:INSERT INTO customers (id, email, customer_data) VALUES-- Mobile customer with different structureDespite the varying structures, you can still query across all customer types:customer_data->>'source' AS source,

    COALESCE(
        customer_data->'web_data'->>'first_visit',
        customer_data->'mobile_data'->>'app_version',
        customer_data->'crm_data'->>'account_manager'
    ) AS source_specific_data,
customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'city' AS city,
jsonb_array_length(customer_data->'purchases') AS purchase_count
FROM customers
WHERE (customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country') = 'USA';WHERE (customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country') = 'USA'When getting such WHERE query, PostgreSQL does following steps:Extracts the string value at that pathWith a traditional JSON text column, this would require parsing the entire document. With JSONB, PostgreSQL can navigate directly to the relevant portion of the binary structure. The data in the SELECT statement is processed similarly.documentationThanks to the binary, hierarchical structure we just described, PostgreSQL can index JSONB data.Creating a GIN index is straightforward:CREATE INDEX idx_customer_data ON customers USING GIN (customer_data);
When PostgreSQL builds this index, it:Iterates through every JSONB document in the tableExtracts each key and value pair at every level of nestingCreates index entries for each key and for each scalar valueOrganises these entries in a tree structure optimised for lookupsThe resulting index is usefull for certain operations like:customer_data @> '{"tags": ["premium"]}'customer_data ? 'promotion_code'WHERE customer_data ?| array['discount', 'coupon', 'promotion_code']These queries can use the GIN index directly without extracting paths, making them highly efficient even with large datasets. The execution plan would show something like:Bitmap Heap Scan on customers  (cost=4.26..8.27 rows=1 width=32)
  Recheck Cond: (customer_data @> '{"tags": ["premium"]}'::jsonb)
  ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_customer_data  (cost=0.00..4.26 rows=1 width=0)
        Index Cond: (customer_data @> '{"tags": ["premium"]}'::jsonb)
However, GIN indexes have significant drawbacks:They can be large, sometimes larger than the table itself.They can slow down write operations.They require more maintenance (vacuum).They don't help with range queries or sorting.For each key or scalar value, the GIN index maintains a posting list of row IDs where that element appears. These posting lists are compressed and optimised for fast intersection operations, which is why containment checks are so efficient.When PostgreSQL executes a containment query like:customer_data @> '{"status": "active", "type": "business"}Looks up the posting list for the key "status" with value "active"Looks up the posting list for the key "type" with value "business"Computes the intersection of these posting listsReturns the matching row IDsThis set-based operation is highly efficient compared to extracting and comparing values from each document.B-Tree index-- Index for a specific extracted field
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_source ON customers ((customer_data->>'source'));
(customer_data->>'source')The execution plan for a query using this index would show:Index Scan using idx_customer_source on customers  (cost=0.28..8.29 rows=1 width=32)
  Index Cond: ((customer_data->>'source'::text) = 'website'::text)
Are much smaller than GIN indexes,Have less impact on write performance,Support range queries and sorting,Only help with queries that exactly match the indexed expression.What’s more, you can also use it to set up unique constraints and get the same strong checks as for regular tables!Understanding the internal mechanisms helps explain why you might want different index types for different query patterns.For more specific query patterns, you can combine these approaches:-- Location-based index for frequently filtered fields
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_country ON customers ((customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country'));

-- Specialized conditional index for specific customer types
CREATE INDEX idx_web_utm ON customers ((customer_data->'web_data'->>'utm_source'))
WHERE customer_data->>'source' = 'website';
customer_data->>'source' = 'website'-- Query that can use the partial index
SELECT id FROM customers 
WHERE customer_data->>'source' = 'website' 
AND customer_data->'web_data'->>'utm_source' = 'google';
Internally, PostgreSQL maintains separate metadata about which index portions apply to which queries. The query planner uses statistics about data distribution to decide whether to use an index or not, which explains why sometimes PostgreSQL might choose a sequential scan even when an index exists.Suppose we have a table with 1 million customer records, and we frequently run queries to find customers from specific countries:-- Without an index, this requires scanning all records
SELECT id FROM customers 
WHERE customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country' = 'Germany';
The execution plan would show:Seq Scan on customers  (cost=0.00..24053.00 rows=10000 width=32)
  Filter: ((customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country'::text) = 'Germany'::text)
After adding an appropriate index:CREATE INDEX idx_country ON customers ((customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country'));
The execution plan becomes:Index Scan using idx_country on customers  (cost=0.42..341.50 rows=10000 width=32)
  Index Cond: ((customer_data->'contact'->'address'->>'country'::text) = 'Germany'::text)
This can reduce query time from seconds to milliseconds. But the choice between GIN and B-Tree indexes isn't always obvious. If we frequently need to find customers with specific combinations of attributes, a GIN index might be better:-- Query that benefits from a GIN index
SELECT id FROM customers 
WHERE customer_data @> '{"contact": {"address": {"country": "Germany"}}, "status": "active"}';
Performance is good enough for most typical cases, and if you don’t have a huge amount of data, the performance of JSONB with indexing is similar to traditional columns. Still, if it’s worth knowing that JSONB:Can perform worse for simple single-value lookups: Traditional columns with B-Tree indexes typically outperform JSONB path extraction,can perform better for retrieving complete complex objects. Avoiding joins can lead to significant performance advantages,Has variable performance for analytical queries: Depending on indexing strategy, can be either much faster or much slower than normalised dataWhile JSONB offers flexibility, it has performance characteristics you should understand, especially for large documentsTOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique)A common anti-pattern is storing large arrays or deeply nested structures in a single JSONB document.You don't have to abandon all data validation when using JSONB. PostgreSQL allows you to enforce constraints on JSONB documents:ALTER TABLE customers ADD CONSTRAINT valid_customer
CHECK (
    customer_data ? 'id' AND 
    customer_data ? 'email' AND 
    customer_data ? 'source' AND
    customer_data ? 'contact'
)ALTER TABLE customers ADD CONSTRAINT valid_web_customer
CHECK (
    customer_data->>'source' != 'website' OR 
    (customer_data ? 'web_data' AND customer_data->'web_data' ? 'first_visit')
)These constraints leverage PostgreSQL's ability to check path existence and values within the binary representation. Internally, PostgreSQL evaluates these expressions during insert and update operations, using the same path traversal algorithms that power queries.PostgreSQL 12+ introduces a powerful new way to work with JSONB through the SQL/JSON path language. This provides a more expressive syntax for complex data extraction:SELECT jsonb_path_query(
    customer_data, 
    '$.purchases[*] ? (@.amount > 10 && @.subscription == true)'
) 
FROM customers;
This query finds all purchases that are subscriptions with an amount greater than 10. The path expression is evaluated against each document, and matching elements are returned.Internally, PostgreSQL parses the path expression into an execution plan specific to JSON path traversal.JSONB works well with PostgreSQL's aggregation functions:-- Find average purchase amount across all customers
SELECT AVG(
    (jsonb_array_elements(customer_data->'purchases')->>'amount')::numeric
) 
FROM customers;

-- Group purchases by product type
SELECT 
    COALESCE(p->>'product_id', p->>'item_id') AS product,
    COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    customers,
    jsonb_array_elements(customer_data->'purchases') AS p
GROUP BY 
    product;
Of course, you can mix traditional columns with JSONB ones. For those columns that you know will always exist, or are the same, you can set up regular tables, and those with weaker schema, you can use JSONB.CREATE TABLE customers (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- Common fields as columns
    -- Variable parts as JSONB
    source_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    contact_info JSONB NOT NULL,
    purchases JSONB NOT NULL
);
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: schema enforcement where it matters and flexibility where needed. It's often the most practical approach in real-world systems. The hybrid aligns with PostgreSQL's internal implementation. Traditional columns can use the highly optimised columnar storage and indexing mechanisms PostgreSQL has refined over decades, while JSONB columns leverage the specialised binary representation for flexible data.JSONB represents a practical compromise between rigid relational schemas and completely schemaless document databases.Of course, in scenarios requiring absolute top performance, like business analytics with complex filtering, data warehousing, or very high-throughput OLTP systems, traditional columns with specialised indexes often perform better. In practice, a hybrid approach works best: use traditional columns for fixed, frequently queried attributes and JSONB for variable parts of your data.Big strength of JSONB is handling schema evolution.With JSONB, you can evolve your schema more gracefully. When business requirements change and you need to store additional data, you don't need to modify the database schema. Your application can simply start including new fields in the JSON documents it writes, and older documents without those fields continue to work fine.I’m biased, but I extremely like JSONB and have used it in the past in my system. It can speed up development for line-of-business applications. Syntax can be a bit tricky, but once you learn it, or provide some wrapper it works like a charm.https://github.com/event-driven-io/pongoPongo treats PostgreSQL as a Document Database, benefiting from JSONB support. Unlike the plain text storage of the traditional JSON type, JSONB stores JSON data in a binary format. This simple change brings significant advantages in terms of performance and storage efficiency.See also my video where I explained internals of both Pongo and JSONB:p.s.

The name he chose as Pope refers to St Francis of Assisi. He set out to reform the Vatican; he advocated climate protection and inter-religious dialogue.

In March 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina was elected 266th Pope, the first South American to become spiritual leader of the Catholic Church. He set out to reform the Vatican and the papal office, advocated climate protection and inter-religious dialogue.The name he chose toi be known by refers to St Francis of Assisi. Following "the little poor man’s” example, Bergoglio wanted a "poor church for the poor".

In memory of Pope Francis, Deutsche Welle is rebroadcasting the feature "Pope Francis — A Shepherd in the Storm.” On the occasion of the Pope's 85th birthday in December 2021 our report was an opportunity to take stock of his pontificate. What was this Pope able to change and reform; where were his limits? How did he lead the Catholic faith community through a time marked by crises and scandals? We gave people who knew Pope Francis personally, priests who advised him or were critical of his initiatives, and of course the Catholic laity, with their hopes and belief in a just pope, the opportunity to share their image of Pope Francis.

The news comes as Washington signaled readiness to drop ceasefire efforts within the coming days unless progress is achieved. Ukraine's feedback is expected at a follow-up meeting in London later this week. If there is alignment between Kyiv, Washington, and European allies, the proposals could be formally introduced to Moscow.Among the most controversial elements is the suggestion that the U.S. could formally recognize Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. Additionally, Ukrainian accession to NATO would be ruled out under the current proposal. "NATO isn’t on the table," said U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg in an interview with Fox News on April 20.Ukraine has previously said it would not recognize occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal. The move to recognize Crimea under Russian rule also contradicts a decade-long bipartisan consensus in Washington and international law.In 2018, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed U.S. opposition to the annexation, calling it a threat to "a bedrock international principle shared by democratic states: that no country can change the borders of another by force." The U.S. Congress has also passed legislation opposing any recognition of Russia’s claim over Crimea.Ukraine has also previously rejected restrictions on joining international alliances and organizations—namely, NATO and the EU—as part of a potential peace deal. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently said that Kyiv's path toward membership remains "irreversible" but added that the matter would not be part of an eventual peace settlement.The Ukrainian delegation in Paris included Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. According to the WSJ, the Trump team, including Kellogg and special envoy Steve Witkoff, should be present at the London meeting as well.Witkoff is then expected to travel to Moscow, the WSJ reported. Officially the special envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has led Trump's diplomatic outreach to Russia, meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin three times, most recently on April 11.In a comment to the WSJ, a senior State Department official emphasized that the ideas were presented as "potential options" rather than ultimatums, though Kyiv is expected to offer a firm stance quickly.Another proposal would involve establishing a neutral zone around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, potentially leaving it under American control.In an earlier call with Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suggested the idea of the U.S. acquiring Ukrainian energy assets, which he said could be the "best protection for that infrastructure."While the U.S. proposals stop short of granting Russia formal legal recognition of its claimed annexation of four partially occupied eastern Ukrainian regions, they also do not call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from those areas. 
Since 2022, Moscow has illegally declared Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of the Russian Federation, incorporating them into its Constitution and demanding the complete retreat of Ukrainian forces from their administrative borders.The Trump administration has not ruled out bilateral military assistance to Ukraine or support for European nations contributing forces to a "reassurance force," a potential buffer against future aggression. However, no specific security guarantees have yet been offered as part of the proposed deal.This goes in contrast with Russian demands for a full halt of military support to Ukraine, which the Kremlin voiced as a precondition to a 30-day ceasefire suggested by the Trump administration over a month ago. While Ukraine has accepted the offer if Russia reciprocates, Moscow has not yet supported the idea. In recent weeks, Russia has intensified attacks on civilians in Ukrainian cities.During talks with the U.S. representatives in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin officials were reportedly seeking relief from U.S. sanctions and the restoration of trade ties, efforts being led by Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev.Zelensky’s office has not publicly commented on the details of the U.S. proposal. On April 19, Ukrainian officials reaffirmed openness to a mutual 30-day ceasefire, though they accused Moscow of violating a temporary truce over the Easter holiday on April 20.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Britain to ramp up explosives production to end reliance on US arms</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/article/7828a2dd-91ea-462c-8b86-63f681dc106b?shareToken=b90ad01a8ae191172a85ae16def4936c</link><author>/u/tree_boom</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 07:35:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Strengthening homegrown artillery production is an important step in learning the lessons from Ukraine, boosting our industrial resilience and making defence an engine for growth,” he said. By the summer, BAE will have increased its production of 155mm rounds — the Nato-standard ammunition — 16-fold over two years to meet the demand fuelled by the Ukraine war. The Times is aware of the number of rounds the UK can now produce but has been asked not to disclose it for security reasons.Using a world-first innovative technique — amounting to the biggest shake up in explosive manufacturing in five decades — BAE now wants to produce its own sovereign explosives and market the technology across the globe. Previously BAE Systems imported RDX explosives from two main sources, the US and France.The company, the largest defence contractor in Europe, is hoping to reach a position where its munitions are deemed to be “Itar-free”, essentially without any US components or material so they can be used and sold on without being subject to any restrictions from America.There are also fears that should a wider war break out, western nations will be scrambling to purchase and produce munitions, meaning the UK needs its own sovereign capability to produce explosives.Francis Tusa, a defence analyst briefed on BAE’s plans, said: “If you don’t have the ammunition you can’t fight. This announcement shows someone has woken up to the fact that in times of stress the open market for ammunition disappears and having your own plants and ability to create raw explosives and propellant isn’t just a nice thing to have, it is a must have.”Itar, which stands for the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, refers to a set of longstanding US rules that govern the items on the United States Munitions List aimed at safeguarding national security.The list contains US-produced software, components and other technology which can be used for either military purposes or serve a dual purpose. If a weapon is subject to Itar, it cannot be built, sold or supplied to someone else, without US consent and support.Trump’s tariff war, suspension of military and intelligence aid to Ukraine and threats to Canada and Denmark have made British and European countries concerned about relying on US defence equipment in the future.155mm rounds are currently used by the British Army in its Archer self-propelled howitzer and the AS-90 armoured self-propelled artillery.BAE Systems is the only company in the UK to produce the 155mm rounds and much of the ammunition has been given to Ukraine, leaving the UK dangerously short.Steve Cardew, the business development director at BAE Systems’ Maritime and Land Defence Solutions, said: “The whole challenge for our industry is around production scale up and creating enough industrial capacity to effectively match Russia and other hostile nations.”In an interview with The Times, he explained that RDX explosives used in 155mm rounds, mortars and warheads were normally developed in a relatively inefficient large-scale facility, however European nations were struggling to produce explosives at scale.Under the plans outlined by BAE, each individual shipping container will produce up to 100 tonnes a year of explosives on a much smaller scale but one that is more efficient, cheaper and quicker. It is also more resilient in terms of security, he explained. “One large facility is clearly a big security threat. If you have dispersed facilities, it is much more secure.”The innovative technology the firm has developed, using automation, has been proven as a concept and BAE now plans to manufacture its own explosives at scale. The system will then be sold to other countries so they can also produce their own sovereign explosives.At the moment, 155mm rounds or weapons produced with explosive material from the US are subject to Itar restrictions. Cardew said that in future BAE would be able to sell its products on the basis they are “Itar-free”.He said the “global security scenario” had “forced” BAE to accelerate the development of its explosives work in an environment where there was more demand for munitions globally than there was the industrial base to supply it.“Making sure we have our own access to our own supply chains is really important. We clearly have enough supply chain access for what we have today but going forward, continuing to rely on that will generate risk and therefore we are keen to make sure that the UK has its own supply chain,” he said.Asked about concerns over Trump’s erratic behaviour, he said: “What is going on in the US is clearly one facet of a general view we have got that the world is becoming increasingly unstable and therefore we need to protect ourselves and our supply chain accordingly. I don’t think it is just about the US.”He said the need for such unique technology was at an “all time high” and had “tremendous potential”.Every day Russia is firing about 12,000 rounds, compared with around 7,000 fired by the Ukrainians, according to Ukrainian military sources. Six plants in North Korea are now supplying Moscow with its ammunition, amounting to some 45 per cent of Russia’s needs, two sources said.BAE will deliver the 16-fold increase in 155mm rounds when its new explosive filling facility at Glascoed, south Wales, becomes operational this summer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do you route traffic to different Kubernetes clusters?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1k47goc/how_do_you_route_traffic_to_different_kubernetes/</link><author>/u/Deeblock</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 07:11:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have two clusters set up with Gateway API.

They are concise, readable, and powerful.In fact, they’re  delightful that many developers use f-strings for everything… even when they shouldn’t!Alas, f-strings are often dangerously (mis)used to format strings that contain user input. I’ve seen f-strings used for SQL (f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_name}'") and for HTML (f"<div>{user_name}</div>"). These are not safe! If  contains a malicious value, it can lead to SQL injection or cross-site scripting.Template strings are a  of Python’s f-strings. Whereas f-strings immediately become a string, t-strings evaluate to a new type, string.templatelib.Template:Importantly,  instances are  strings. The  type does not provide its own  implementation, which is to say that calling  does not return a useful value. Templates  be processed before they can be used; that processing code can be written by the developer or provided by a library and can safely escape the dynamic content.We can imagine a library that provides an  function that takes a  and returns a safely escaped string:Of course, t-strings are useful for more than just safety; they also allow for more flexible string processing. For example, that  function could return a new type, . It could also accept all sorts of useful substitutions in the HTML itself:If you’ve worked with JavaScript, t-strings may feel familiar. They are the pythonic parallel to JavaScript’s tagged templates.How do I work with t-strings?To support processing, s give developers access to the string and its interpolated values  they are combined into a final string.The  and  properties of a  return tuples:There is always one more (possibly empty) string than value. That is,  and t"{name}".strings == ("", "").As a shortcut, it’s also possible to iterate over a :Developers writing complex processing code can also access the gory details of each interpolation:In addition to supporting the literal () form, s can also be instantiated directly:Strings and interpolations can be provided to the  constructor in any order.A simple t-string exampleLet’s say we wanted to write code to convert all substituted words into pig latin. All it takes is a simple function:What’s next once t-strings ship?T-strings are a powerful new feature that will make Python string processing safer and more flexible. I hope to see them used in all sorts of libraries and frameworks, especially those that deal with user input.In addition, I hope that the tooling ecosystem will adapt to support t-strings. For instance, I’d love to see  and  format t-string , and  those contents, if they’re a common type like HTML or SQL.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wine 10.6 Released With New Command Processor Lexer, 27 Bug Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-10.6-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After missing its bi-weekly development release regiment this past Friday, Wine 10.6 was tagged on Sunday as the newest routine update to this open-source software that enables Windows applications and games to run on Linux and other platforms...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Solo Satoshi Announces 10,000 Bitaxe Miners Distributed Globally!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/solo-satoshi-announces-10000-bitaxe-miners-distributed-globally?source=rss</link><author>Anon</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 03:16:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining, once a playground for tech hobbyists, has increasingly been overtaken by corporate giants, but a grassroots revolution is gaining momentum. On April 15, 2025, Solo Satoshi announced a pivotal milestone on X: over 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, contributing more than 10 petahashes of hashpower to bitcoin home miners globally. Fueled by a chaotic, unplanned flash sale, this achievement signals a global shift, with Bitaxe miners humming in homes from North America to Africa, Europe to Asia. These compact devices are bringing mining back to the people, enabling anyone to strengthen Bitcoin’s decentralized network. This article dives into the Bitaxe’s technology, its role in home mining, and the milestone that proves small bitcoin mining machines can reshape the future of Bitcoin.A Global Milestone for Home MiningThe sale of 10,000 Bitaxe miners marks a turning point for Bitcoin. Each miner represents an individual or small group bolstering the network’s security, collectively delivering over 10 petahashes (10 quadrillion hashes per second) of computational power. Operating in diverse settings, from rural cottages to urban apartments, these devices show that solo mining is not a relic; it’s a reality. The global spread of Bitaxe miners highlights a rising demand for accessible, efficient tools that empower everyday people to contribute to Bitcoin’s decentralized ecosystem.\
   This milestone was driven by a spontaneous flash sale for the Bitaxe Gamma, priced at $125.99. Launched on a whim by Solo Satoshi, the sale sparked a frenzy, pushing the company past the 10,000-device mark. Unlike the massive Antminer rigs dominating corporate mining farms, the Bitaxe offers a compact, energy-efficient option for home use. A weekly giveaway of a Bitaxe 601 Gamma with free global shipping followed, further expanding the device’s reach. As Bitcoin’s halving events reduce the block reward every four years, efficiency becomes critical, making the Bitaxe’s role increasingly vital.Solo Satoshi: Pioneering Access to BitaxeFounded in May 2024, Solo Satoshi is led by Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, a trio committed to making Bitcoin mining accessible. Matt’s strategic insight, Hunter’s technical knowledge, and Kelsie’s operational expertise drive the company’s efforts through their website, solosatoshi.com. As sellers of Bitaxe miners, they focus on connecting people with open-source bitcoin mining hardware, providing resources and a community hub for enthusiasts.The Open-Source Movement in Bitcoin MiningBitaxe is a product of the open-source movement, a core principle of Bitcoin’s philosophy. Created by @skot9000 (on X), the Bitaxe’s designs, schematics, and firmware are freely available on Github, inviting anyone with technical curiosity to build, modify, or enhance the device. This openness fosters a global community of developers and miners who share knowledge and drive innovation. Unlike proprietary systems that restrict users to rigid ecosystems, the Bitaxe encourages customization, making it a versatile tool for learning and contributing to Bitcoin’s security. \
   The open-source approach is gaining momentum as home miners seek alternatives to expensive, controlled hardware. By providing access to the Bitaxe’s blueprints, the community ensures mining remains inclusive, enabling hobbyists and small-scale miners to participate affordably. This movement aligns with Bitcoin’s values of transparency and decentralization, positioning the Bitaxe as a beacon of resistance against centralized control in mining.Centralization Fears in Bitcoin MiningLarge-scale mining operations have sparked concerns about Bitcoin’s decentralization. Insights from sources like Ocean (a decentralized mining pool) and other industry voices highlight key risks. First, the concentration of hashpower in a few major pools could enable collusion, allowing dominant players to manipulate transaction confirmations or prioritize specific transactions. Second, geographic centralization in regions with cheap electricity creates vulnerabilities to regulatory actions or natural disasters. Third, proprietary hardware limits innovation and locks miners into costly systems. Finally, the environmental impact of industrial mining, with its energy-intensive farms, has raised sustainability concerns.\
   The Bitaxe miner counters these issues by enabling individuals to contribute hashpower from their homes, reducing dependence on centralized pools. Its open-source design challenges proprietary hardware monopolies, and its low energy consumption supports greener mining practices. For those pursuing lottery mining (where a solo miner competes for the rare chance to mine a block and claim the full block reward), the Bitaxe provides a practical way to participate independently.The Bitaxe, instigated by @skot9000, is a compact, open-source Bitcoin mining device designed to make mining accessible to everyone. When it first appeared, few outside the open-source community recognized its potential, but Solo Satoshi, among the earliest adopters, championed it through sales on their website and the X platform, helping it reach thousands. The Bitaxe is engineered for home use, delivering 1.2 terahashes per second (TH/s) while consuming just 18 watts, a fraction of the power required by industrial miners. This efficiency makes it ideal for small-scale home mining setups, offering a stark contrast to the resource-heavy equipment of large operations.\
   The Bitaxe Gamma, exemplifies its user-friendly design. With plug-and-play functionality, beginners can connect the device to a power supply, change a few settings, and start mining bitcoin in minutes, no complex setup required. Advanced users benefit from its open-source nature, which allows customization, such as modifying firmware and the plethora of adjustments that can be made through AxeOS (The Bitaxe’s operating system). The Bitaxe’s compact size, 40mm fan, and very low heat output means it can run quietly on a desk or shelf, blending seamlessly into home environments. Unlike traditional miners that demand specialized cooling or infrastructure, the Bitaxe is built for simplicity and accessibility\
   Versatility is a hallmark of the Bitaxe. It supports solo mining, where miners compete independently for block rewards, as well as pool mining for more consistent payouts. Its affordability and efficiency appeal to hobbyists, educators, and those mining to support Bitcoin’s network rather than solely for profit. The device also doubles as an educational tool, helping users explore blockchain technology and mining mechanics hands-on. By distributing the Bitaxe, Solo Satoshi has made this technology widely available, enabling a new wave of miners to engage with Bitcoin’s ecosystem.The Rise of Home Mining: Plebs Take ChargeHome mining is experiencing a revival, powered by devices like the Bitaxe. In Bitcoin’s early days, anyone with a computer could mine, but rising difficulty shifted the landscape to industrial farms. The Bitaxe reverses this trend, allowing ordinary people to run miners from their homes, contributing to Bitcoin’s security. This movement is about more than earning rewards; it’s about upholding Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos.\
   The Bitaxe’s simplicity makes home mining feasible. With low power costs (comparable to a lightbulb) and minimal setup, it fits into any household. Miners need only a stable Wi-Fi and a small space, and the device’s quiet operation ensures it runs without disruption. For many, the excitement of solo mining, chasing the elusive block reward through lottery mining, is a driving force, but even pool miners strengthen the network’s resilience.\
  Stories of home miners illustrate the Bitaxe’s impact. A student in Tokyo mines from their dorm to learn about blockchain, while a retiree in Texas runs a Bitaxe to support Bitcoin’s mission. These plebs, as the Bitcoin community affectionately calls grassroots enthusiasts, are proving that small-scale mining matters. The 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, represent a growing network of home miners fortifying Bitcoin’s decentralization.A Bright Future for Bitaxe and BitcoinThe milestone of 10,000 Bitaxe miners sold, powered by 10 petahashes and an anarchic flash sale, marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin mining. Matt, Hunter, and Kelsie, through Solo Satoshi, have played a key role by distributing these devices globally, making them accessible to thousands. Their early support for Skot’s creation and their chaotic energy has helped the Bitaxe become a cornerstone of home mining.\
   As Bitcoin grapples with centralization and scalability challenges, the Bitaxe offers a path forward. It empowers individuals to contribute to the network, learn about bitcoin mining, and uphold Bitcoin’s decentralized principles. With every Bitaxe running in a home, the network grows stronger, more resilient, and truer to its roots. Visit solosatoshi.com to explore the Bitaxe and join the movement. Bitcoin’s future lies with the plebs; will you be one of them?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your Career Is Not Your Personality.

You know that hollow feeling when something falls apart and you suddenly have no idea who you are anymore?\
For years, my identity  my business.\
It was my purpose, my personality, my status, my therapy, my everything.\
When I stepped away, I didn’t just lose a job—I lost myself.\
No title. No daily structure. No adrenaline from closing deals.\
Just silence, and a growing voice in my head asking:\
That’s when I discovered something that changed how I see identity forever:\
Identity diversification. (Yes, it sounds like something from your financial advisor. But hear me out.)What the Hell Is Identity Diversification?It’s exactly what it sounds like:\
Don’t bet your entire sense of self on one thing.\
When all your identity eggs are in one basket—your job, your relationship, your role as a parent, or your six-pack—it only takes one hit to send you spiraling.\
It’s fragile. And fragility breaks.\
They build  identity pillars—so when one crumbles, the whole thing doesn’t collapse.\
Every identity—friend, writer, builder, traveler, son, surfer, whatever—is a leg.\
A table with one leg? Wobbly as hell. A table with five? You could throw a bowling ball at it and it’ll still stand.How to Build More Legs (Without Losing Your Mind)Step 1: Audit Your Identity\

Eventually, some of those visitors will become customers.\
I want to share a strategy using dropped domains with backlinks that can bring you long-term web traffic.\
With this approach, I’ve been getting around 100 relevant, unique visitors each month — and it only cost me $36 (I bought three expired domains for a year).Getting new visitors to your site also helps improve your SEO by speeding up page indexing and boosting your rankings on Google.\
Dropped domains often come with backlinks from trusted, high-traffic websites. This is usually because the previous owners promoted the domain through articles, blog posts, videos, and by sharing links across various platforms.\
People still come across those old links and click on them. So if you find a dropped domain that’s still getting traffic, you can buy it and redirect those visitors to your own site.Getting new visitors to your site boost your SEOIf people read, click links, or share your pages, Google notices. Good engagement means good content and that helps your SEO.If people stay longer, it shows your site is useful. That helps rankings, especially in tough niches.Some visitors might link to or share your site.  still SEO gold.\
If new visitors bounce right away, it won’t help and could even hurt your SEO. It’s more about the quality of traffic than just the numbers.Relevant traffic is crucial for SEOIf your traffic isn’t relevant, visitors will quickly realize your site isn’t what they were looking for — and leave immediately.\
This behavior leads to a drop in metrics like Bounce Rate and Visit Duration, which can negatively impact your search rankings over time.Bounce Rate and which is normal?Bounce Rate is the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.\
For blogs, higher bounce rates are normal (people read 1 post and leave). For SaaS, tools, landing pages, you usually want it under 60%.Average Visit Duration and what value is normal?Average Visit Duration means how long people stay on your site on average.\
If your site is just a simple tool or info page, 45 seconds might be fine. But if it’s a content-rich site, you’d want longer.So, traffic from expired domains should be relevant.How to find domains with relevant trafficTo find domains with traffic and backlinks, you can use dropped domain platforms, expired domain services, or domain auctions. I personally prefer using , because it only crawls high-authority, high-traffic websites like Forbes, Medium, and Product Hunt.\
This means it offers high-quality dropped domains with solid backlinks that have a strong chance of still getting traffic. Plus, GoneDomains has helpful filters and data tools that make it easy to find the right domains in just a few clicks.Also it has AI tips, like “Get appraisal” which help to get domain appraisal, understand it value, business potential and in what kind of business domain can be used and so on. Very useful feature.When you find a domain you like, the next step is to check its backlinks. The backlinks should be related to your niche — this ensures the traffic is relevant and helps improve key metrics like Bounce Rate and Average Visit Duration.\
Improving these metrics has a positive impact on your overall SEO, including faster indexing and better search rankings.Setting up a right 301 redirectAfter when you find liked and suitable domains, you need to buy them and setting up a 301 redirect to your main domain.It did the same way but in different section in depends of your registrar, I use Cloudflare free redirect feature.https://gone.domains?ref=expiredomains.today
is called a URL parameter.So this URL is being used for referral tracking.It tells the website analytics that the visitor came from \n Tracking where traffic is coming fromAnalyzing which marketing channels are workingThis parameter is very important for analytics and for keeping track of domains with irrelevant traffic.Regularly check domain trafficCheck your domain’s traffic for relevance once a month. If you notice that a traffic source has a very low visit duration (less than 1 minute), it can negatively affect your SEO.\
You should identify and remove redirects from these low-quality traffic sources to your main site. Otherwise, they can hurt your SEO and impact your business in the long run.Calculation how much it costIt cost me just $36 to buy a bunch of expired domains with traffic for one year.\
They bring me 100 visitors per month, or 1,200 per year.\
At just $0.03 per visitor, it’s very cost-effective, especially when the traffic is real, organic-looking, and relevant.\
Most legitimate paid traffic options are more expensive, unless you’re really good at ad targeting or finding underpriced channels.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Exactly is an AI Agent? Examples and Counterexamples</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent-examples-and-counterexamples?source=rss</link><author>HeraHaven AI</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 02:03:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The term "AI agent" seems to be everywhere lately. From tech news headlines to business strategy discussions, it's rapidly becoming one of the most prominent terms in the artificial intelligence lexicon. Like many popular tech terms, however, its meaning can sometimes get diluted, leading to its use as a catch-all buzzword. So, what really constitutes an AI agent?\
At its core, the defining characteristic of an AI agent is its ability to autonomously perform actions to achieve a goal. This means they don't just process information or respond to direct commands; they interact with their environment (digital or physical), make decisions, and execute tasks with a degree of independence. Humans set the objectives, but the agent figures out the steps and takes them.The key differentiator for an AI agent is its capacity for autonomous action. While many AI tools can process information, generate text, or answer questions, an AI agent goes further. It perceives its environment, whether that's sensor data, user input, or information from the web or databases, and then uses that information to plan and execute actions. These actions could be digital, like sending emails, updating databases, executing trades, or triggering other processes, or physical, in the case of robots or self-driving cars.\
Crucially, this action-oriented nature requires capabilities like reasoning, planning, and often learning or adaptation. The agent needs to understand its goal, figure out the necessary steps, potentially use various tools (like APIs or web searches), and carry out those steps, sometimes correcting its course along the way. This distinguishes agents from simpler AI tools or assistants that primarily respond to user prompts or require human decision-making at each step. Merely gathering and presenting information, however sophisticatedly, doesn't meet this definition. The agent must do something based on that information, moving towards its objective without constant human intervention.When defined by autonomous action, several types of AI systems qualify as agents:Autonomous Driving Systems: Self-driving cars are a prime example. They perceive their environment (roads, obstacles, traffic signals) using sensors, plan navigation paths, and take actions (steering, braking, accelerating) to reach a destination safely.: These agents analyze market data in real-time, make decisions based on predefined (or learned) strategies, and autonomously execute buy or sell orders.Smart Home Controllers (with Action): While some smart home devices merely report status, a true agent might autonomously adjust thermostat settings based on occupancy patterns it learns, or proactively lock doors at a certain time, taking action rather than just providing information or waiting for a command.Autonomous Workflow Tools: Platforms like Auto-GPT or specialized agents built with frameworks like CrewAI aim to take a high-level goal (e.g., "research competitors and summarize findings") and break it down into subtasks, autonomously using tools like web browsers or APIs to gather information, analyze it, and compile a report. Replit Agent is another example that aims to build applications based on natural language prompts.Customer Service Agents (with Action Capability): While many chatbots only answer questions, more advanced agents can perform actions like processing refunds, changing passwords, or updating customer information in a CRM system, directly resolving issues instead of just providing instructions.Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enhanced with AI: Some advanced RPA systems incorporate AI agents that don't just follow pre-programmed rules but can adapt to changes, make decisions within a process, and handle more complex, multi-step workflows autonomously.Counterexamples: What Isn't an AI AgentUnderstanding what isn't an AI agent (under this action-oriented definition) helps clarify the concept:Standard Chatbots (like early ChatGPT): While highly capable at processing language and generating human-like text, chatbots that primarily respond to user prompts without autonomously initiating tasks or interacting with external systems beyond information retrieval generally don't qualify as agents. They react, but don't typically act proactively towards a persistent goal without continuous prompting. Systems that suggest products, movies, or news articles analyze data and make predictions, but they don't autonomously act on those recommendations (e.g., purchasing the item for you). The action relies on the user.Basic Data Analysis Tools: AI tools that analyze datasets and present insights, dashboards, or reports are providing information, not autonomously taking action based on those insights.AI-powered Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly): These tools enhance a user's actions (writing) by providing suggestions or corrections, but they don't autonomously write documents or send emails on the user's behalf based on a goal.Image Recognition Services: AI that identifies objects in images performs a sophisticated perception task but doesn't inherently take autonomous action based on that recognition.While "AI agent" is indeed a term enjoying significant buzz, understanding its core meaning – an AI tool capable of autonomous action towards a goal – is crucial. This ability to perceive, reason, plan, and act independently distinguishes true agents from many other valuable but less autonomous AI tools. As these technologies continue to evolve, recognizing this distinction will be key to understanding their capabilities and potential impact on various tasks and industries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quickly Extract Month Values in Excel with the MONTH Function</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/quickly-extract-month-values-in-excel-with-the-month-function?source=rss</link><author>Excel24x7</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 01:58:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The  function in Excel is used to extract the  from a given input date.

Resilient Multi-Cloud Strategies: Harnessing Kubernetes, Cluster API, and Cell-Based Architecture - Tasdik Rahman & Javi Mosquera, New Relic 

In today's multi-cloud world, resilience and high availability at scale are crucial. This session will cover how we utilized Kubernetes with Cluster API and other cloud native components, to deploy a cell-based architecture across multiple cloud providers, scaling to 270+ clusters and 18,000+ nodes, creating independent, isolated cells that limit failures and improve uptime, thus simplifying compliance, cost management, and disaster recovery planning.

Call the Midwife
In Season 14, the midwives enter the 1970s, which brings with it new challenges for Nonnatus House – and to British society. The Seventies start as they mean to go on, with Nonnatus House plunged into disarray when activists staging a bid for independence blockade access to the Isle of Dogs. Amid the poverty and uncertainty of life in a declining Docklands, the midwives must also face cases of manic depression, gonorrhea, spina bifida, abortion – and an apparently immaculate conception.

But why? Is it due to nutrition? The good weather? Or genetics? Scientists around the world are attempting to solve the mystery.

91-year-old Antonangelo leads a busy life. Every morning, he goes to milk his flock of sheep and later, turns that milk into cheese. "Work is my life, if I stop, I'll die,” says Antonangelo. Like many Sardinians in the mountain regions, he and his wife eat almost exclusively local produce. Their recipes for a long life are exercise and healthy food.

Giuseppino is already 100 years old and still manages most of the steep paths in his home village of Villagrande on foot. Is the strenuous hillside location the secret of his longevity? Giuseppino's family takes care of him, but he still lives alone in his flat and is bursting with energy. For him, a positive attitude and a sense of humor are key to a long life.

Despite a good deal of research, the secrets of the Blue Zones still haven’t been fully explained. But one study from the region does concludes that genetics play an important role in the first half of life. For 91-year-old Carolina, it’s clear that an intact family is a prerequisite for a long life. She has no intention of going into an old people's home. For her, the most important thing is for a mother to grow old with her children. And traditional food preparation is still one of her favorite pastimes.

("After eight years of dedication to the ArcoLinux project and the broader Linux community...") 

'Learn, have fun, and enjoy' was our motto for the past eight years — and I really had fun doing all this," Dubois says in a video version of his farewell post. "And if we reflect back on this teaching and the building and promoting of Linux, it was fun. But the time has come for me to step away..." 

Over its eight years ArcoLinux "accomplished several important milestones," reports Linux magazine, "such as creating over 5,000 educational videos; the creation of ArcoInstall; the Carli education project; the Arch Linux Calamares Installer (ALCI); the ArcoPlasma, ArcoNet, ArcroPro, and Ariser variants; and much more."
According to Dubois, they weren't just creating a distribution but a mindset. 

Dubois says that the code will remain online so others can learn from, fork, or remix the distro. He also indicated that ArcoLinux will supply users with a transition package to help them convert their existing ArcoLinux systems to Arch Linux. That package will remove ArcoLinux branding, replace pacman.conf with an Arch and Chaotic-AUR focused config file, and change the arcolinux-mirrorlist to a single source.
 

 It's FOSS News describes ArcoLinux as one of those "user-friendly Arch-based distros that give you a bleeding-edge experience."
The reasoning behind this move, as shared by Erik, is his advancing age and him realizing that he doesn't have the same level of mental focus or stamina he used to have before. He has found himself making small mistakes, the kind that can negatively affect a major undertaking like this... Come July 1, 2025, the transition period will end, marking a stop to all development, including the deactivation of the ArcoLinux social media handles. The Telegram and Discord communities will stay a bit longer but will close up eventually. 
"I want to leave ArcoLinux while it's still strong, and while I can look back with pride at everything we've accomplished together," Dubois says in their post...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Durable Is A Fitness Tracker? | The Secret Genius of Modern Life | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBYgVGKxnpE</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iBYgVGKxnpE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:01:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Due to their delicate electronics, fitness trackers have to withstand all of the knocks and the bumps that we invariably put them through.

Delivering state-of-the-art performance, Gemma 3 quickly established itself as a leading model capable of running on a single high-end GPU like the NVIDIA H100 using its native BFloat16 (BF16) precision.To make Gemma 3 even more accessible, we are announcing new versions optimized with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) that dramatically reduces memory requirements while maintaining high quality. This enables you to run powerful models like Gemma 3 27B locally on consumer-grade GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090.Understanding performance, precision, and quantizationThe chart above shows the performance (Elo score) of recently released large language models. Higher bars mean better performance in comparisons as rated by humans viewing side-by-side responses from two anonymous models. Below each bar, we indicate the estimated number of NVIDIA H100 GPUs needed to run that model using the BF16 data type.Why BFloat16 for this comparison? BF16 is a common numerical format used during inference of many large models. It means that the model parameters are represented with 16 bits of precision. Using BF16 for all models helps us to make an apples-to-apples comparison of models in a common inference setup. This allows us to compare the inherent capabilities of the models themselves, removing variables like different hardware or optimization techniques like quantization, which we'll discuss next.It's important to note that while this chart uses BF16 for a fair comparison, deploying the very largest models often involves using lower-precision formats like FP8 as a practical necessity to reduce immense hardware requirements (like the number of GPUs), potentially accepting a performance trade-off for feasibility.The Need for AccessibilityWhile top performance on high-end hardware is great for cloud deployments and research, we heard you loud and clear: you want the power of Gemma 3 on the hardware you already own. We're committed to making powerful AI accessible, and that means enabling efficient performance on the consumer-grade GPUs found in desktops, laptops, and even phones.Performance Meets Accessibility with Quantization-Aware Training in Gemma 3This is where quantization comes in. In AI models, quantization reduces the precision of the numbers (the model's parameters) it stores and uses to calculate responses. Think of quantization like compressing an image by reducing the number of colors it uses. Instead of using 16 bits per number (BFloat16), we can use fewer bits, like 8 (int8) or even 4 (int4).Using int4 means each number is represented using only 4 bits – a 4x reduction in data size compared to BF16. Quantization can often lead to performance degradation, so we’re excited to release Gemma 3 models that are robust to quantization. We released several quantized variants for each Gemma 3 model to enable inference with your favorite inference engine, such as Q4_0 (a common quantization format) for Ollama, llama.cpp, and MLX.How do we maintain quality? We use QAT. Instead of just quantizing the model after it's fully trained, QAT incorporates the quantization process during training. QAT simulates low-precision operations during training to allow quantization with less degradation afterwards for smaller, faster models while maintaining accuracy. Diving deeper, we applied QAT on ~5,000 steps using probabilities from the non-quantized checkpoint as targets. We reduce the perplexity drop by 54% (using llama.cpp perplexity evaluation) when quantizing down to Q4_0.See the Difference: Massive VRAM SavingsThe impact of int4 quantization is dramatic. Look at the VRAM (GPU memory) required just to load the model weights: Drops from 54 GB (BF16) to just  (int4) Shrinks from 24 GB (BF16) to only  (int4) Reduces from 8 GB (BF16) to a lean  (int4) Goes from 2 GB (BF16) down to a tiny  (int4)This figure only represents the VRAM required to load the model weights. Running the model also requires additional VRAM for the KV cache, which stores information about the ongoing conversation and depends on the context lengthRun Gemma 3 on Your DeviceThese dramatic reductions unlock the ability to run larger, powerful models on widely available consumer hardware: Now fits comfortably on a single desktop NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) or similar card, allowing you to run our largest Gemma 3 variant locally. Runs efficiently on laptop GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM), bringing powerful AI capabilities to portable machines. Offer even greater accessibility for systems with more constrained resources, including phones and toasters (if you have a good one).Easy Integration with Popular ToolsWe want you to be able to use these models easily within your preferred workflow. Our official int4 and Q4_0 unquantized QAT models are available on Hugging Face and Kaggle. We’ve partnered with popular developer tools that enable seamlessly trying out the QAT-based quantized checkpoints: Get running quickly – all our Gemma 3 QAT models are natively supported starting today with a simple command. Easily download and run Gemma 3 QAT models on your desktop via its user-friendly interface. Leverage MLX for efficient, optimized inference of Gemma 3 QAT models on Apple Silicon. Use our dedicated C++ implementation for highly efficient inference directly on the CPU. Integrate easily into existing workflows thanks to native support for our GGUF-formatted QAT models.More Quantizations in the GemmaverseOur official Quantization Aware Trained (QAT) models provide a high-quality baseline, but the vibrant Gemmaverse offers many alternatives. These often use Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), with significant contributions from members such as Bartowski, Unsloth, and GGML readily available on Hugging Face. Exploring these community options provides a wider spectrum of size, speed, and quality trade-offs to fit specific needs.Bringing state-of-the-art AI performance to accessible hardware is a key step in democratizing AI development. With Gemma 3 models, optimized through QAT, you can now leverage cutting-edge capabilities on your own desktop or laptop.Explore the quantized models and start building:We can't wait to see what you build with Gemma 3 running locally!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sway 1.11-rc1 Released With Many New Features &amp; New Wayland Protocols</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Sway-1.11-rc1-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 12:02:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sway 1.11-rc1 is out today as a test release ahead of this next Wayland compositor feature release.

Leonard Clark and his family, spanning three generations in the village, have meticulously documented over 1,000 sunken ships. They seek to help the people of the Magdalen Islands, all descendants of shipwrecked sailors, to uncover their ancestry.  Leonard, an amateur archaeologist and shipwreck descendent, has dedicated his life to unraveling the history of the Magdalen Islands, tracing the origins of numerous shipwrecks, and deciphering clues to sunken treasures claimed by the sea. Along this unique journey, Leonard Clark shares historical insights and tales of sunken treasures with Mario Cyr, a local hero and globally acclaimed underwater cameraman.

Valkey is backed by the Linux Foundation, Google, Amazon Web Services, and Oracle, which the article points out is due to Redis's decision last year to shift the upstream Redis license from a BSD 3-clause to RSALv2 and SSPLv1.


Valkey is replacing Redis in the Arch Linux extra repository and after a two week period the Redis package will be moved out to AUR and receive no further updates. Users are encouraged to migrate to Valkey as soon as possible.

Bedouins on dozens of pickup trucks follow them, cheering them on and trying to keep pace. Welcome to Zalaga!

The annual camel race in Zalaga, in the south of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, is one of the oldest and most famous in the world. For decades, this Bedouin tradition has been passed down from generation to generation. And every year, children are selected to ride the camels. Most of them come from impoverished backgrounds and hope the job will earn them some money. The film accompanies one of these boys as he prepares for the big race. Life in the desert is tough. The boys must rely on themselves: Far away from their families, they have little prospect of a decent education.

Why are ‘belief systems’ so powerful? How do they control religion and politics and all ways of thinking from a scientific worldview to conspiracy theories? What is a ‘belief system’? It is a set of tenets or convictions that support each other, such that the whole system governs individual beliefs. How we believe may be more important than what we believe.

Over 55 million people worldwide live with dementia, a number expected to rise to 139 million by 2050, with the greatest increases in low and middle-income countries where 60% of people affected by dementia already live.

Studies show that being part of a community, being physically active and eating healthily are some of the things that can help maintain the quality of life for dementia patients.

Overtakes were often missed and strategies were often ill-explained or missed. I discovered that F1 live timing data is available over a simple SignalR stream, so I set out building an app that would let me see all the information I could dream of. Now undercutf1 serves as the perfect companion (like a second Martin Brundle) when I'm watching the sessions live.If you want to test it out, you replay the Suzuka race easily by downloading the timing data, then starting a simulated session:1. Download undercutf1 using the installation instructions in the README.2. Import the Suzuka race session data using `undercutf1 import 2025 -m 1256 -s 10006`.3. Start the app (`undercutf1`) then press S (Session) then F (Simulated Session), then select Suzuka then Race using the arrow keys, then press Enter.4. Use arrow keys to navigate between the timing pages, and use N / Shift+N to fast-forward through the session.If you want to test it out during this weekends Jeddah GP, simply install as in the README then start a live session by pressing S (Session) then L (Live Session).The app is built for a terminal of roughly 110x30 cells, which probably seems an odd size but just so happens to be the size of a fullscreen terminal on a MBP zoomed in far enough that the text is easily glanceable when the laptop is placed on a coffee table some distance away from me :) Other terminal sizes will work fine, but information density/scaling may not be ideal.If you're using the TUI during a live session, you'll want to synchronise the delay of the timing feed to your TV feed. Use the N/M keys to increase/decrease the delay. During non-race session, I find it fairly easy to sync the session clock on TV with the session clock on the bottom left of the timing screen. For race sessions, synchronisation is a little harder. I usually aim to sync the start of the race time (e.g. 13:00 on the timing screen clock) with the start of the formation lap, where the live feed helpfully shows the clock tick over to 0 minutes. I usually delay the feed by 30 to 60 seconds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move</title><link>https://www.servethehome.com/synology-lost-the-plot-with-hard-drive-locking-move/</link><author>motiejus</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 06:48:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I dislike writing these articles, but here we are. According to HardwareLuxx, Synology is on a rough course with generations-old sub-par NAS hardware and now appears to be locking its NAS units to its own branded hard drives in its upcoming 2025 Plus models. This is a shame since a few years ago, Synology had neat hardware.Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking MoveTranslating a relevant bit for our readers.“…since an estimated hard drive health report is essential for both private and professional use, this creates a compulsion to use Synology’s own or equivalent drives. Additionally, certain features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party devices will be disabled. There are also restrictions on the creation of storage pools, as well as, of course, support in the event of failures, which are not further specified.” (: Translated from HardwareLuxx)Changing this to require Synology branded drives in the “Plus” line is silly. There are only a handful of hard drive manufacturers, and Synology does not have anywhere near the scale to compete at hard drive manufacturing. Consolidation in the hard drive industry was driven by huge economies of scale benefits. Without scale, and a library of patents, it is a very hard market to enter. As a result, Synology must be simply re-branding drives. Labeling drives as a “Dell”, “NetApp”, “HPE”, or other big vendor drive has been going on for years (decades?) on both the hard drive and SSD sides of storage. Realistically, there is usually very little that gets changed in vendor firmware from the drive manufacturer firmware. When we see some changes, it is usually in conjunction with a branded storage controller that also has corresponding firmware changes. Firmware tweaks very rarely target the built-in PCH or SoC SATA controllers on Intel, AMD, and Arm platforms in the mainstream server and storage market.Let us just call this what it is. It is a grab for extra margin dollars. The challenge is that it is bad for Synology’s customers. For example, the Synology Plus series only scales to 16TB currently with the HAT3310-16T. Synology’s enterprise series scales to 20TB. WD Red Pro drives are already pushing 26TB. Or in other words, in an 8-bay desktop NAS segment to use Synology’s branded drives with Synology’s full feature set has a maximum raw capacity of 128TB. For a QNAP or TrueNAS 8-bay, that is 208TB of raw capacity.We just looked at the drives on Amazon, to see when they would be available and their pricing.WD Red Pro 16TB has an estimated delivery date of April 25 to April 29 (Amazon Affiliate link) while being $10 less expensiveToshiba N300 Pro 16TB has an estimated delivery date of May 4 to May 9 (Amazon Affiliate link) while being $11 less expensiveToshiba N300 16TB (CMR) is showing overnight availability so April 19 (Amazon Affiliate Link) and is $35 less expensiveSeagate IronWolf Pro 16TB is showing same day availability so April 18 (Amazon Affiliate link) but is $10 more expensiveWhen a drive fails, one of the key factors in data security is how fast an array can be rebuilt into a healthy status. Of course, Amazon is just one vendor, but they have the distribution to do same-day and early morning overnight parts to a large portion of the US. Even overnighting a drive that arrives by noon from another vendor would be slower to arrive than two of the four other options at Amazon.For Synology customers, the challenge of being vendor-locked into using Synology branded drives is not just about alleged firmware improvements. It is also about being able to keep data secure while finding easy replacements. A NAS in 2025 needs to work with any NAS rated hard drive because frankly there are not that many vendors out there. If a particular model was found to have a very high year 2 failure rate, you would naturally want to start replacing drives with a different model. Vendor locking features to specific Synology drives prevents this, but it also allows Synology to use different vendors behind the label without telling its customers.Additionally, there can also be concerns about drive availability in the long-term. If your NAS is vendor-locked to only use Synology drives, then as owner of that NAS you are fully dependent upon Synology’s survival as a company and that they would continue manufacturing drives in the capacity points that you want. Sure, they make 2TB and 4TB model Synology drives today, but what about four years from now when you need a replacement drive? What if Synology sells or merges with some other technology vendor, or goes out of business? This move creates concerns within the Synology ecosystem that did not exist before, and that is not good for customers.Many will notice that Synology devices have been largely absent from STH even though Synology is a very popular NAS solution. That is not by chance. While I actually like the company’s software, Synology’s NAS hardware feels extremely dated to the point that it feels like most of the solutions are running generations old hardware. The combination of neglecting hardware refresh cycles and now vendor locking features to only using Synology drives will ultimately hurt users. I cannot imagine recommending a NAS solution where I could not get a replacement drive in under 24 hours, if at all, and that makes Synology extremely hard to recommend in 2025. If the situation changes, then I am happy to have our team review more Synology gear. In the meantime, there are plenty of other options out there.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Goldbach Conjecture up to 4*10^18+7*10^13</title><link>https://medium.com/@jay_gridbach/grid-computing-shatters-world-record-for-goldbach-conjecture-verification-1ef3dc58a38d</link><author>jay_gridbach</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 06:11:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new challenge to a 280-year-old unsolved mathematical problemI’ve achieved a new world record in verifying the Goldbach Conjecture, a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, by extending the verification up to 4 quintillion (4×10¹⁸) + 70 trillion (7×10¹³). This article introduces Gridbach, the grid computing system I developed for this computation.Check out my live grid computing system here:https://gridbach.comNo login is required. You can immediately see the computation results on both PC and mobile.I am @jay_gridbach, a freelance engineer and consultant based in Kanagawa, Japan. Currently, I work as a PreSales engineer at a company in Tokyo, while also developing web applications and my own services. Gridbach is a project I’ve been nurturing since my corporate days, and I’m thrilled to release it in April 2025.The Goldbach Conjecture, proposed by Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach in 1742, remains an unsolved problem in mathematics. Despite the efforts of numerous modern mathematicians, no one has proven it mathematically. The conjecture itself is simple enough for a middle school student to understand:“Every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers”4 = 2 + 26 = 3 + 3………1000000000001092576 = 1913 + 1000000000001090663…While it’s believed to be true, a mathematical proof for all even numbers is still elusive.In 2013, T. Oliveira e Silva from Portugal verified the conjecture up to 4×10¹⁸ using computers. This was the previous world record.https://sweet.ua.pt/tos/goldbach.htmlMy newly developed Gridbach system has slightly surpassed this record by adding 70 trillion to the verified range. I aim to push this further to 5 quintillion by increasing the number of participating machines and improving my algorithms. I’m not sure how to get this recognized as an official record, but I’m willing to write a paper if necessary. If anyone has insights on this, please let me know.Gridbach is a cloud-based distributed computing system accessible from any PC or smartphone.It requires no login or app installation. The high-performance WASM (WebAssembly) binary code is downloaded as browser content, enabling computation on the user’s browser.Each computation job covers a range of 100 million (50 million even numbers), taking about 5–10 seconds on a PC and 10–20 seconds on a smartphone.Inspired by SETI@home, I’ve aimed to create a system that anyone can easily join.My system uses a combination of high-performance WASM for efficient computation and a highly scalable JAMStack architecture.The challenges and lessons learned in choosing and setting up this stack are worth a separate post.The app is simple, offering two main features: running computations on your machine and viewing the collective results from all Gridbach users. It’s also mobile-friendly.For details on the dashboard data, please visit - https://app.gridbach.com/I define “Goldbach Ridge” as the maximum value of the smaller prime in the prime pairs satisfying the Goldbach Conjecture within a given range.While T. Oliveira e Silva refers to these as the smaller prime  in the Goldbach partition, I named them as “ridge” as graphing these looks like mountain peaks and cols.Oliveira e Silva al. discovered a large Goldbach ridge of 9781:Feel free to join in and see if you can find some bigger peaks! So far, 6421 is the largest one found on my system. Your top 30 Goldbach Peaks are displayed on the My Calculation screen.The core computation logic of mine is open-sourced as a Go command-line tool under the MIT license.https://github.com/nakatahr/gridbach-coreHere’s a snippet of the code. I’ve upgraded the Sieve of Eratosthenes to use bitwise operations on byte arrays for faster prime number generation, and optimized it for given ranges.I also plan to write a separate article about the computation algorithm.Thank you for reading! Please take 5 minutes to try the computation on gridbach.com. I aim to continue breaking records and improving the system, hoping to spark interest in mathematics and IT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.15-rc3 To Bring AMD Zen 5 Microcode Protection, Intel Bartlett Lake ID Addition</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-rc3-x86-Fixes</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:23:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged today ahead of the Linux 6.15-rc3 kernel test release on Sunday were the set of "x86 fixes" for the week.

Python’s GitHub repository, arguing that after a recent CVE in its implementation of
SHA3, Python should embrace verified code for all of its hash-related infrastructure.As of last week, this issue is now closed, and every single hash and HMAC algorithm exposed by
default in Python is now provided by HACL*, the
verified cryptographic library. There was no loss of functionality, and the transition was entirely
transparent for Python users. Python now vendors (includes in its repository) 15,000 lines of
verified C code from HACL*. Pulling newer versions from the upstream HACL* repository
is entirely automated and is done by invoking a script. HACL* was able to successfully implement
new features to meet all of the requirements of Python, such as: additional modes for the Blake2
family of algorithms, a new API for SHA3 that covers all Keccak variants, strict abstraction
patterns to deal with build system difficulties, proper error management (notably, allocation
failures), and instantiating HACL’s generic “streaming” functionality with the HMAC algorithm,
including an optimization that requires keeping two hash states at once.This is the culmination of 2.5 years of work, and could not have happened without the invaluable
help of Aymeric Fromherz, who shouldered a lot of the
implementation burden. Son Ho had a key contribution early on, generalizing
HACL’s “streaming” functionality to be able to handle block algorithms that require a “pre-input”.
This slightly obscure generalization was actually essential to implement a suitable, optimized HMAC
that keeps two hash states under the hood. On the Python side, Gregory P. Smith, Bénédikt Tran, and
later Chris Eibl were big champions and provided a lot of help. Finally, the HACS series of
workshops created connections (hello, Paul Kehrer!) and provided sufficient momentum to make this
happen. A warm thank you to both the Python and verified cryptographic communities!As I oftentimes like to do, I’ll provide a little bit of a look behind the scenes, and comment on
some of the more interesting technical aspects that are too low-level for a research paper.A Primer on Streaming APIsMany cryptographic algorithms are  algorithms, meaning that they assume their input is
provided block by block, with special treatment for the first and last blocks. Well-known block
algorithms include hash algorithms, MAC algorithms (e.g. Poly1305, HMAC), and more. In practice, the
block API is not user-friendly: rarely does one have the data already chunked in blocks;
furthermore, computing a result (e.g., a hash) invalidates the state of the block algorithm, which
makes e.g. computing the intermediary hashes of the TLS transcript difficult.For these reasons, cryptographic libraries typically expose  APIs, meaning clients can
provide inputs of any length; the library then takes care of buffering the input, flushing the
buffer as soon as a full block is obtained. A streaming API typically also allows extracting
intermediary hashes without invalidating the state.Streaming APIs are hard, because they manipulate long-lived state with complex invariants: the
(unverified) reference implementation of SHA3 was hit with a bad
CVE in 2022, which Python “inherited”, because it
vendored that very same SHA3 implementation.Streaming APIs are hard also because the
underlying block algorithms differ in a myriad of different ways: all hash algorithms accept an
empty final block,  for Blake2; some need to retain the key at run-time (Poly1305), some can discard it
after initialization (HMAC, optimized); some need some initial input before processing the key
(Blake2), some don’t; and so on.Given this inherent complexity, streaming algorithms are a good candidate for verification: we wrote
a research paper in 2021 about this very problem.Fully generic verificationThe main idea from the paper is that one can capture, using dependent types, what a block algorithm
. Once that’s done, it suffices to author and verify a generic streaming construction once and
for all over an abstract definition of block algorithms. Then, just like you instantiate a template
in C++, you apply the generic streaming construction to a concrete block API and voilà – a
streaming API for that one block algorithm, “for free”.The fist hitch is that there’s quite a big delta between what we presented in the paper (Listing
12), and what actually lives in the
repository.
Specifically, capturing  block algorithm requires a lot of genericity.The user may or may not specify the length of the final digest – for instance,
each SHA3 hash has a fixed output length, but the Shake variants produce a result whose length is
user-provided.The block algorithm may expect to receive a pre-input before the blocks of data. For e.g. SHA2,
the pre-input is empty, but for Blake2 in keyed hash mode, the pre-input is the key block.Blocks cannot be processed eagerly, because some algorithms (Blake2) do not allow for the final
block to be empty – this vastly complicates buffer management, and interacts with the pre-input.Some algorithms need to retain extra pieces of state: for instance, the key length for Blake2 can
be tweaked at initialization-time, but needs to be retained in the long-lived state.To avoid invalidating the block state upon intermediary digest extraction, our streaming API
copies the state under the hood – in some cases, it’s easier to stack-allocate this copy, but in
other cases, a heap-allocated copy makes more sense.In some cases, we wanted one API per algorithm (we have four APIs for
SHA2-{224,256,384,512}); in other cases, we wanted one API per algorithm family (we have one API
that covers all 6 Keccak algorithms: 4 variants of SHA3, and 2 variants of Shake).Getting to that level of genericity took multiple rounds, driven by the successive requirements of
Python. Ultimately, for HMAC, which was the final algorithm we landed in Python, we realized that
our proofs and definitions were generic enough that we did not need any further tweaks to
“instantiate” our generic streaming API with HMAC.One highlight of submitting a PR to Python is that their infrastructure has more CI coverage than we
could possibly dream of: a complete build of Python runs over 50+ toolchains and architectures. The
flipside? We discovered some pretty annoying corner cases.One particularly tricky build issue surfaced when dealing with HMAC. As a reminder,
HMAC is a generic construction that, given a hash algorithm,
provides a keyed message authentication code – in short, there is a high-level HMAC piece of code
that defers most of the work to individual hash algorithms. Each hash algorithm may itself come in a
variety of : for instance, HMAC-Blake2b is implemented both by HMAC-Blake2b-32
(regular implementation) and HMAC-Blake2b-256 (AVX2 wide-vector implementation).This already causes problems:  may call functions from , if Python is running
on a machine with AVX2. However, only  may be compiled with : code from
 will execute on all machines, even those without AVX2, meaning it must  be compiled
with . So far, so good, and this is something we had done before.The problem came with  creating the initial state for :Most toolchains were happy with this code –  defines the type , and even
though  cannot assume AVX2 instructions are available, it’s not to hard for a
compiler to zero-initialize  without resorting to AVX2 instructions… except,
some older compilers refused to process the  header unless  was used, which
defeated the whole purpose.This required a considerable amount of refactoring to use the well-known “C abstract struct”
pattern, which essentially defines an abstract type in C.What made this extra difficult is that the C code is auto-generated from F*, which has a 
different notion of abstraction. The compiler that goes from F* to C,
krml, had to be overhauled to perform a much more
fine-grained analysis that handles various levels of visibility (public functions, library-internal
functions, translation-unit internal functions) even in the presence of such “abstract structs”.Handling memory allocation failuresWhile our original modeling of C in F* allowed reasoning about memory allocation failures, no one
had ever bothered to do so in practice. For Python, it was desirable to be able to propagate memory
allocation failures. This meant we had to refine our definition of a generic, mutable piece of state
(such as the block state); our definition of a block algorithm (such as SHA2-256); and our generic
streaming construction to all be able to propagate memory allocation failures all the way up to the
caller. Thankfully, this didn’t turn out to be a huge deal: we inserted  types all along the
way, and because we had one single generic streaming construction, the implementation and proofs had
to be updated only once for the 15+ concrete instances of the streaming API.The presence of  types in the source compiles to tagged unions in the generated C; this is a
little verbose, and we may change our definition of a piece of state to feature a 
run-time function that can assess whether a memory allocation failed, at the expense of more
complexity and verification effort.Propagating changes from upstream HACL* to PythonMy initial Python PR contained a shell script that would fetch the required files from the upstream
HACL* repository; ditch a bunch of superfluous definitions in headers via well-crafted sed
invocations; and tweak a few include paths in-place, also using my favorite refactoring tool (yes,
sed). The benefit was the the initial PR was lean and clean.Later on, once it became clear that the upstream code was maintainable and pretty stable, that pile
of seds was eliminated, on the basis that it’s not the end of the world if a header contains a few
extra definitions, and it all makes maintenance easier.Now, anyone who wishes to refresh HACL* can run the shell script in their checkout of Python, and
provided they tweak the expected hash in Python’s SBOM (software bill of materials), they are good

project like Python. This demonstrates that verified cryptographic is not only ready from an
academic perspective, but also mature enough to be integrated in real-world software while meeting
all engineering expectations.

Spirituality requires consciousness because we need to be aware, and to be self-aware, in order to apprehend spirituality of any kind. But is there more to the relationship? Some make the extravagant claim that our human consciousness is somehow connected directly to a’ cosmic consciousness’? Can this make sense? If so, what would it mean?

The game embodies two of my favorite aspects of tabletop RPGs: strategic teamwork and memorable anecdotes. It does struggle to be fun when you're playing solo, but that feels like it's clearly the wrong way to play the tabletop-inspired, turn-based tactical RPG, which really only comes together when different minds are working together to coordinate their respective perks and customized deck of card-based abilities to strategically accomplish the task at hand.In Sunderfolk, each player takes control of one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an arcanist crow, a pyromancer axolotl, a ranger goat, a bard bat, a berserker polar bear, or a rogue weasel. After proving themselves capable bouncers in a tavern, the heroes band together to protect their home village, Arden, from a series of escalating threats and try to find a way to prevent the growing corruption of the magical tree that keeps everyone safe from the coming darkness. It's your typical run-of-the-mill fantasy setup, with would-be heroes rising to heed the call of adventure when no one else will, and for the first few hours, Sunderfolk doesn't do much to differentiate itself from contemporary stories.But then you get to really know the NPCs, and Sunderfolk's story starts to make its mark with its varied cast of characters, all of whom are voiced by actor Anjali Bhimani to replicate the experience of playing a tabletop adventure with a Game Master who is portraying all the non-hero characters. Bhimani does an incredible job adjusting the pitch, tone, accent, and speed of her voice to add a distinct flavor to every character, injecting a feeling of life into the narrative that makes it easy to love the heroes' allies and effortless to hate the villains. My friends and I were far more invested in saving the village and discovering what was going on upon meeting an adorable, one-armed penguin orphan named Amaia who was doing her best to keep Arden's mines running, especially once her cruel and lying uncle was introduced. We vowed to do everything to save the little bird (and desperately hoped her uncle would be revealed as the true big bad so that we'd have a chance to destroy him), and much of that emotional investment, as well as our feelings about the other characters, was derived from Bhimani's portrayal.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Judge Rules Blanket Search of Cell Tower Data Unconstitutional</title><link>https://www.404media.co/judge-rules-blanket-search-of-cell-tower-data-unconstitutional/</link><author>bradac56</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 18:16:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Judge says tower dumps violate the 4th amendment, but will let the cops do it this one time, as a treat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: (bits) of a Libc, Optimized for Wasm</title><link>https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/sqlite3/libc</link><author>ncruces</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 18:06:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I make a no-CGO Go SQLite driver, by compiling the amalgamation to Wasm, then loading the result with wazero (a CGO-free Wasm runtime).To compile SQLite, I use wasi-sdk, which uses wasi-libc, which is based on musl.

This is fine, except size_t is just 32-bit on Wasm.I found that implementing a few of those functions with Wasm SIMD128 can make them go around 4x faster.Other functions don't even use SWAR; redoing  can make them 16x faster.Smooth sort also has trouble pulling its own weight; a Shell sort seems both simpler and faster, while similarly avoiding recursion, allocations and the addressable stack.I found that using SIMD intrinsics (rather than SWAR) makes it easier to avoid UB, but the code would definitely benefit from more eyeballs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Slightly Faster AES-XTS Performance For AVX-512 CPUs Expected With Linux 6.16</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.16-AES-XTS-AVX-512-Fast</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 17:55:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent kernel releases there have been performance enhancements to the AES implementations and other cryptographic subsystem code for speeding up the performance on modern Intel and AMD processors.

I made it as a week long project a while back this year but never shared here, so thought to go for it haha.I created a game inspired by Doom and the backrooms called The Backdooms under 2.4kb in minified html. (for reference, this entire post would be around 1.8kB haha)
I had to use a not popular way of using GZip with Zlib headers (had to write my own script for compressing it, also in the repo) to eventually convert it a size 40 QR code that works right in your browser using Decompressionstream API.This is of course a very oversimplified description of it, using a lot of the same technologies that DOOM had but combining it with infinite seed based map generation in 2.4kb (QR codes can only store 3kb, which includes changing formats) was pretty hard.Here are some links about it if you want to nerd out and read more:(PS: You'd need something like https://qrscanner.org/ or something that can scan bigger QR codes and put the text data onto your browser to play it)My Blogs documenting the process and development in detail:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Attune - Build and publish APT repositories in seconds</title><link>https://github.com/attunehq/attune</link><author>ilikebits</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:14:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey HN, we're Eliza and Xin, and we’ve been working on Attune. Attune is a tool for publishing Linux packages.Previously, we worked at other startups building open source developer tools that ran on our customers’ CI and development machines. For many of them, being able to `apt-get install` our tools was a requirement.When we went to actually set up APT repositories, we were really surprised by the state of tooling around package publishing. The open source tools we found were old, slow, and difficult to figure out how to run in CI. The commercial tools we found were not much better. The cloud-hosted vendors required us to provide our signing keys to a cloud vendor (which was a non-starter), while the self-hosted vendors required us to operate our own specialized hosting servers.We just wanted something simple: sign locally, run quickly, be easy to use, and deploy to managed object storage.We couldn’t find it, so we built it. If you want to try it out, you can create a repository with three commands:    attune repo create --uri https://apt.releases.example.com
    attune repo pkg add --repo-id 123 package.deb
    attune repo sync --repo-id 123

You can get the tool at https://github.com/attunehq/attune. There are a lot of rough edges right now since it's so new - sorry in advance, we're working on sanding those down.It’s fully open source under Apache 2. We’re also working with some early customers to build enterprise features like audit logging, RBAC, and HSM integrations, and we’re thinking about building a managed cloud hosting service as well.We’d love your feedback on whether this is useful for you, and what you’d like to see next. We’re well aware that publishing is a small piece of CI/CD, but we think a lot of the tooling in this area (publishing, artifact registries, package repositories) could really use some love.What do you think?

The film accompanies these men of faith and combat, from their recruitment in Switzerland to their military training in the heart of the Vatican.

Made up of 150 men, this elite corps lives in barracks in the heart of Vatican City. All must be Swiss nationals and devout Catholics. All have sworn to fight to the death to protect their faith and the Holy Father.

They are heirs to a 500-year-old tradition in which the Pope’s protection and security were assured by mercenaries from Switzerland.

Trained to wield both halberds and semi-automatic assault rifles, the Swiss Guards form a unique army. But who are they really? What motivates these young boys to join this military and religious corps? An insight into a world usually closed to the cameras.

Science is humankind’s magnificent achievement, the way of thinking to discern facts and truths and to reject errors and myths. But how to understand the scientific method itself and what is it really that science is learning? That’s the role of philosophy. For example, when science discerns ‘regularities’ in nature, are these ‘laws’ of nature?

But given that Bear Grylls is an outdoor expert who survived a massive fall while in the British Special Forces, climbed Mt. Everest before he was 25, and traversed the North Atlantic in an inflatable raft, he gets the benefit of the doubt.  But evidence suggests Grylls may not be as rugged a survivalist as he seems. In fact, some of his wilderness tips have even been called into question by other experts. So what gives?

Traffic was up almost 20% last quarter, while industry-wide, it fell almost 4%. Food chains like TGI Friday’s, Hooters and Red Lobster have all recently filed for bankruptcy. So what is Chili’s doing differently to succeed?

Hochman sits down with WSJ to explain what’s next for Chili’s Bar & Grill.

Here’s why.

Every spring, millions of people are left coughing, sneezing, and itching their way out of winter. It’s a sign that nature is blooming back to life, dumping a ton of pollen into the air — and, subsequently, our respiratory tracts. Seasonal allergies are undeniably miserable, so it’s unsurprising that people are looking for miracle cures. One popular idea is to try and microdose pollen with honey.

The theory goes like this: Pollen causes seasonal allergies. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowering plants to produce honey. So…a small amount of pollen is found in honey, therefore if you eat local honey you can introduce small amounts of pollen to your immune system and help your body gradually build an immunity to it. Boom. Seasonal allergies cured. The only problem? It doesn’t actually work, but honey does have a ton of other benefits. Watch the video above to learn more.

ABSTRACT
Responsible technology is having its time in the sun currently. Concerns about misinformation, bias, data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and accessibility issues, to name just a few of the concerns, seem to appear everywhere in the media. Who is the latest organization to be breached? Which airport is recovering from an "incident" - that wonderfully vague word?

Delivering technology in a responsible manner includes considering all the stakeholders to the solution, not just the obvious ones. The various flavors of architects operating across a solution (perhaps just a small number of people wearing different hats) must attempt to bring the perspectives of other stakeholders into the discussion surrounding features, targets, security requirements, and more. Making this work can be a challenge for teams.

In this talk, I will first discuss some principles of responsible technology and describe the various ways that making tech responsible generates value for organizations. I will then discuss how various aspects of responsible tech intersect with our good friends the -ilities. Finally, I will describe some techniques that can be used to support teams on their way to building responsible technology. [...]

DESCRIPTION
In a spirited discussion on collaborative modeling and decision-making, the the authors of “Collaborative Software Design: How to Facilitate Domain Modeling Decisions”—Evelyn vVan Kelle, Gien Verschatse, and Kenny Baas-Schwegler—explored the power of inclusive decision-making, shared understanding, and how to navigate social dynamics like bias, ranking and conflict in teams together with Xin Yao.

They highlighted the importance of facilitating not just through structured methods, but by empowering everyone in the team to contribute and lead decisions. Drawing from their experiences, they shared insights into the process of making better decisions through collaboration, the impact of "Deep Democracy", and the value of being able to step back and allow teams to thrive independently. Their conversation also touched on resources like Thinking, Fast and Slow, Jam Cultures, and Sitting in the Fire—tools to help teams make smarter decisions and grow together.

We want to deliver a search experience that prioritises human needs, allowing you to explore the web effectively, privately, and without manipulation. We evaluate new technologies not for their acclaim but for their true potential to support our mission.Since its launch, Kagi Assistant has been a favorite for many users as it allows access to world top large language models, grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place in one beautiful user interface - and all that for +$15/mo upgrade from our Professional plan that provides unlimited Kagi Search.Today, we’re excited to announce that Kagi Assistant is now available to all users across all plans, expanding from its previous exclusivity to Ultimate subscribers, as an added value to all Kagi customers, without increasing the price. We are enabling the Assistant for all users in phases, based on regions, starting with USA today. The full rollout for ‘Assistant for All’ is scheduled to be completed by Sunday, 23:59 UTC.AI serves a defined, search-relevant context: Kagi Assistant is a research aid.AI enhances, it doesn’t replace: Kagi Search remains our core offering, functioning independently. Kagi Assistant is an optional tool you can use as needed.AI should enhance humanity, not diminish it: Our goal is to improve your research process by helping you synthesise information or explore topics grounded in Kagi Search results, not to replace your critical thinking.Kagi Assistant embodies these principles, working within the context of Kagi’s search results to provide a new way to interact with information. It’s built to make research easier while respecting your privacy and AI’s limits.By making Kagi Assistant available to everyone, we’re giving all users the choice to explore this capability as part of their Kagi toolkit - at no additional cost to their subscription. Use it when and how it suits your workflow, knowing it’s built with privacy, responsibility, and human-centric values at its core.Let’s talk about the specifics!AI grounded in Kagi search, guided by youWhen you enable web access, the Assistant has access to Kagi Search results. It will also respect your personalised domain rankings and allows the use of Lenses to narrow search scope.Or, if you’d prefer to discuss directly with the model, you can also turn off web access. It also supports file uploads, allowing you to provide additional context or information for your queries.Custom assistants tailored to your needsCreate specialized assistants with unique instructions, defining their purpose, context, and web access preferences. Need help with coding, grammar reviews, or diagnosing an issue with your classic VW Bus? Build an assistant for it.Pro-tip: assign a custom bang (!name) for instant access via your browser’s search bar.Refine and redirect with editingConversations don’t always go as planned. If a response misses the mark, Kagi Assistant lets you edit prompts, switch models, or adjust settings mid-thread. This ensures you stay in control and can redirect the conversation without starting over.Your privacy is our priority. Assistant threads are private by default, automatically expire based on your settings, and your interaction data is not used to train AI models.  This applies to both Kagi and third-party providers, under strict contractual terms.A note on our fair-use policyProviding powerful AI tools requires significant resources. To ensure sustainability, we’re starting to enforce our fair-use policy.Basically our policy states that you can use AI models based on your plan’s value. For example, a $25 monthly plan allows up to $25 worth of raw token cost across all models (there is a 20% built-in margin that we reserve for providing searches, development and infrastructure for the service). From our token usage statistics, 95% of users should never hit this limit.While most users won’t be affected, those exceeding the generous threshold will have the possibility to renew their subscription cycle instantly. Soon, we’ll introduce credit top-ups for added flexibility. This approach ensures a fair, user-funded model while maintaining quality service and is a simple way to control usage, compared to arbitrary usage limits found in other services.Your favourite models are waiting for youChoose from a range of leading LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more. You can switch models mid-thread and explore their performance through our regularly updated open-source LLM benchmark.  Choice of models in non-Ultimate plans will be limited compared to our full offering in the Ultimate plan, please see below.Access to your favourite LLMs makes Kagi Assistant mould to your requirements and query customisations, so we feature an array of models for you to choose from.Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinkingDeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70BThis is just the beginning for Kagi Assistant. Explore more in our documentation.Happy fetching,
Team Kagi.Q: Does using a less costly model (like DeepSeek) compared to larger ones use fewer credits? Yes. The fair use policy calculates usage based on the actual cost charged by the model provider. Therefore, using smaller, less expensive models will allow for significantly more token usage compared to larger models.Q: Does Kagi receive discounted rates from AI model providers? No, Kagi does not receive discounts. However, we utilize smart caching techniques for the models to reduce operational costs, and these savings are passed on to the user.Q: Why did Kagi start enforcing the fair use policy? The policy was enforced due to excessive use. For instance, the top 10 users accounted for approximately 14% of the total costs, with some individuals consistently using up to 50 million tokens per week on the most advanced models. Our profit margins are already quite narrow. 95% of users should never hit any usage limits.Q: What is the specific usage limit? The limit corresponds directly to the monetary value of your Kagi plan, converted into an equivalent token amount. For example, a $25 plan provides $25 worth of token usage. This calculation includes a 20% margin for Kagi to cover search provision, development, and infrastructure costs. Savings achieved through prompt caching and other optimizations are passed on to you.Q: Where can I view my token usage? Currently, you can monitor your token usage on the Consumption page: https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption. We plan to display cost and interaction details more prominently soon, potentially on the billing page or directly within the Assistant interface.Q: I can not access Assistant!
A: We are doing staged rollout beginning with USA, full rollout scheduled by Sunday, 23:59 UTC.

When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named "Sam" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented on Hacker News and Reddit.This marks the latest instance of AI confabulations (also called "hallucinations") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of "creative gap-filling" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch.For companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Basketball Coach Shares Coaching Philosophy -- and Really Hard Drills | Home Court Advantage</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVYR18c_LcE</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mVYR18c_LcE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 22:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Official website: https://to.pbs.org/IL_2024 | #IndieLensPBS

At one-one-thousandth of a second after the Big Bang, the great annihilation event should have wiped out all matter, leaving a universe of only radiation. Why still don't know why any matter survived. Well, a new finding from the LHC brings us one step closer to understanding why there's something rather than nothing.

Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or off. The model also allows developers to set thinking budgets to find the right tradeoff between quality, cost, and latency. Even with  developers can maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash, and improve performance.Our Gemini 2.5 models are thinking models, capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding. Instead of immediately generating an output, the model can perform a "thinking" process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response. On complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning (like solving math problems or analyzing research questions), the thinking process allows the model to arrive at more accurate and comprehensive answers. In fact, Gemini 2.5 Flash performs strongly on Hard Prompts in LMArena, second only to 2.5 Pro.Our most cost-efficient thinking model2.5 Flash continues to lead as the model with the best price-to-performance ratio.Fine-grained controls to manage thinkingWe know that different use cases have different tradeoffs in quality, cost, and latency. To give developers flexibility, we’ve enabled setting a  that offers fine-grained control over the maximum number of tokens a model can generate while thinking. A higher budget allows the model to reason further to improve quality. Importantly, though, the budget sets a cap on how much 2.5 Flash can think, but the model does not use the full budget if the prompt does not require it.The model is trained to know how long to think for a given prompt, and therefore automatically decides how much to think based on the perceived task complexity.If you want to keep the lowest cost and latency while still improving performance over 2.0 Flash, set the thinking budget to 0. You can also choose to set a specific token budget for the thinking phase using a parameter in the API or the slider in Google AI Studio and in Vertex AI. The budget can range from 0 to 24576 tokens for 2.5 Flash.The following prompts demonstrate how much reasoning may be used in the 2.5 Flash’s default mode.Prompts requiring low reasoning: “Thank you” in Spanish How many provinces does Canada have?Prompts requiring medium reasoning: You roll two dice. What’s the probability they add up to 7? My gym has pickup hours for basketball between 9-3pm on MWF and between 2-8pm on Tuesday and Saturday. If I work 9-6pm 5 days a week and want to play 5 hours of basketball on weekdays, create a schedule for me to make it all work.Prompts requiring high reasoning: A cantilever beam of length L=3m has a rectangular cross-section (width b=0.1m, height h=0.2m) and is made of steel (E=200 GPa). It is subjected to a uniformly distributed load w=5 kN/m along its entire length and a point load P=10 kN at its free end. Calculate the maximum bending stress (σ_max). Write a function evaluate_cells(cells: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, float] that computes the values of spreadsheet cells.Or a formula like  using , , , and other cells.Resolve dependencies between cells.Handle operator precedence ( before ).Detect cycles and raise ValueError("Cycle detected at <cell>").No . Use only built-in libraries.Start building with Gemini 2.5 Flash todayGemini 2.5 Flash with thinking capabilities is now available in preview via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and in Vertex AI, and in a dedicated dropdown in the Gemini app. We encourage you to experiment with the  parameter and explore how controllable reasoning can help you solve more complex problems.We will continue to improve Gemini 2.5 Flash, with more coming soon, before we make it generally available for full production use.Model pricing is sourced from Artificial Analysis & Company Documentation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rare Personal Items Recovered from Titanic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-PGO-dGSuA</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x-PGO-dGSuA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Dan Snow in this new film as he gets special access to a selection of incredible artefacts recovered from the Titanic including a pocket watch, a letter written aboard the ill-fated liner and the never before seen water-stained tickets discovered on the body of third class passenger, Ernest Tomlin.

Sponsored Keynote: Fluent Bit vs. OpenTelemetry Collector - Why Not Both? Margaret Dawson, Chronosphere

Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry Collector are often seen as competing solutions—but that’s not the full story. Many teams use both, but figuring out when and how isn’t always obvious.
This session breaks down the top question we hear: When does it make sense to use Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry Collector, or both?

Open source observability isn’t about picking winners—it’s about making the right tradeoffs for your needs. Interoperability gives us options, and options give us power. As vendors and contributors, our job isn’t to build walls—it’s to build bridges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Observability by Design: Leveraging OpenTelemetry Weaver To Take Con... osh Suereth &amp; Laurent Querel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJt6LyJEYD0</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BJt6LyJEYD0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:55:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Operationalizing Observability: The Invisible Parts - Hazel Weakly, Nivenly Foundation

Observability is increasingly becoming a differentiator in developer experience and in sustaining system health. Despite this, vendor bills are higher than ever, infrastructure budgets are lower, and the ROI is increasingly harder to sell.

Join Hazel in this talk as she takes you through:
- What it takes to get buy-in, what what that looks like, and when to not
- What happens after procurement: Going from zero to day one
- Achieving ROI beyond the engineering function

This talk will be be packed full with actionable insights for employees wanting to implement observability, vendors wanting to sell, and OSS projects working to make the system better.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Observability Day | Project Updates - Observability Project Maintainers</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAZNoJtlJvM</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tAZNoJtlJvM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:55:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

From Chaos To Clarity: Scaling Observability at Dropbox With Centralized Logging Solution - Alok Ranjan, Dropbox Inc

At Dropbox, managing observability for systems producing terabytes of logs daily posed a unique challenge. Initially, developers accessed logs by logging into individual servers, a process further complicated when we moved to containers. Containers are short-lived, which caused logs to disappear on termination. This highlighted the need for a scalable, persisted, centralized solution using open-source tools.

In this session, I’ll discuss our journey to build a robust observability framework centered on Loki as our logging solution. Scaling Loki to Dropbox’s data volume required extensive optimizations for reliable, efficient query performance. I’ll cover our deployment, challenges, and strategies for achieving high-performance logging.

We also integrated Grafana to unify logs and metrics in a single view, enhancing troubleshooting and security. Join us to learn how Dropbox scaled its observability with open-source solutions and key lessons from our experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Observability Day | Closing Remarks - Anna Kapuścińska &amp; Austin Parker, Program Committee Co-Chairs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd-8rkLugFc</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rd-8rkLugFc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:54:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Manage Cloud Native LLM Workloads Across Edge and Cloud Seamlessly Using KubeEdge and WasmEdge - Vivian Hu, Second State & Fei Xu, Huawei Cloud

LLMs moving beyond data centers to edge devices. While this migration promises reduced latency and enhanced privacy, challenges come: maintaining accuracy within limited resources, and cross-device deployment problems.

The integration of KubeEdge and WasmEdge addresses the challenge. WasmeEdge is a lightweight, portable runtime (less than 50MB) without external dependencies. The KubeEdge Sedna orchestrates the edge-cloud collaboration. It monitors inference accuracy and automatically routes requests to cloud-based models when edge processing doesn't meet accuracy thresholds.

This session will demo that small LLMs provide quick, local inference at the edge. When higher accuracy is needed, Sedna seamlessly transitions to larger models in the cloud. The inference workload is built in Rust and compiled to Wasm, enabling deployment across edge and cloud without any changes.

The solution has been implemented in production across multiple industries like aerospace and bank branches.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2306 - Deric Poston</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lqL-OQukxlY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:19:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deric Poston is a standup comic and host, along with Ehsan Ahmad, of "The Solid Show."

Borne out of desperation and bound to fail, the revolt becomes one of the key events of World War Two.

In 1940, hundreds of thousands of people, most of them Jewish, were crammed into a few square kilometers in the Polish capital Warsaw under the most terrible living conditions. The deportations to extermination camps began in 1942. A Jewish resistance organization was formed. SS troops marched into the ghetto in April 1943 and were met by hundreds of fighters who tried to push them back by force of arms.

The courage of these people has largely been forgotten. Many of those heroic Jewish fighters were women. The film hears the account of two of those women, Cywia Lubetkin and Rachel Auerbach, who survived the Holocaust and whose stories have never been heard. Through the interlinking of their narratives, the film sheds light on neglected, unknown aspects of the Warsaw revolt.

--

Plants assume a variety of forms, and trees are just one of them. What makes or breaks a tree can come down to some pretty specific characteristics, based on how the plant develops as a result of how it evolved. Trees don’t all comprise one closely related group, like insects or mammals. So, how exactly do trees get classified as trees? Max G. Levy explains what distinguishes these woody plants.

Conflicting religions fill the world. Doctrines about God contradict one another. No one denies the diversity of religions and the apparent incompatibility of their core beliefs. Many believe only their own religion to be the truth. Some claim all religions reflect the same truth. Others assert that differing dogmas expose the emptiness of all religion.

Most of the country’s biggest companies including Amazon and Google are incorporated in Delaware, but after a series of controversial court decisions, a wave of companies are looking at an exit. Business incorporation accounted for nearly 30% of revenue for DE in 2024, so what’s at stake for the state?

WSJ spoke with Gov. Matt Meyer and a corporate lawyer to explain how the state is fighting back – and why it matters.

In this post we argue that Americans should welcome the disappearance of TikTok because the company is causing harm to children, adolescents, and young adults at an industrial scale. Our evidence comes mostly from research done by those 14 Attorneys General. Some of their briefs have been posted online for the world to see. The briefs include hundreds of quotations from internal reports, memos, Slack conversations, and public statements in which executives and employees of TikTok acknowledge and discuss the harms that their company is causing to children. We organize the evidence into five clusters of harms:Addictive, compulsive, and problematic useDepression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-harm, and suicidePorn, violence, and drugsSextortion, CSAM, and sexual exploitationTikTok knows about underage use and takes little actioncompany insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms,“Compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety,”“interfer[ing] with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”Although these harms are known, the company often chooses not to act. For example, one TikTok employee explained,“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems”  “not a priority for any other team.”“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing” “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy. “Normalization of Pedophilia”“Minor Sexual Solicitation”“leading minors off platform”“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”improperly redactedtry it yourselfour versiona separate Google doc.2024 report from Pew Below you can see that TikTok is aiming to create just such compulsive use, which in turn can lead to problematic use disorders and behavioral addictions, which then compound the harms in the other four clusters. The company does this even though many of its employees believe their product is bad for children’s development.]TikTok’s executives and employees have admitted that they target young Americans, stating:“It’s better to have young people as an early adopter, especially the teenagers in the U.S. Why? They [sic] got a lot of time.Teenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience . . . . If you look at China, the teenage culture doesn’t exist — the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don’t have the time and luxury to play social media appsKY P. 8, PARA 19 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]TikTok knows that the harmful effects of its Platform wreak havoc on the mental health of millions of American children and teenagers and harms them. Its executives have admitted:“The product in itself has baked into it compulsive use.The reason kids watch TikTok is because the algo[rithm] is really good. . . . But I think we need to be cognizant of what it might mean for other opportunities. And when I say other opportunities, I literally mean sleep, and eating, and moving around the room, and looking at somebody in the eyes.KY P. 20, PARA 64 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]arms race for attention[.][Below is a redacted graph from para 67 of KY brief. It shows that TikTok has reached saturation among the 29.7 million US users under the age of 17 who own a smartphone. This means that they can’t get more young users, but they can get more time out of each user, especially if they pull them away from competing platforms.]KY P. 40, PARA 121 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“As expected, across most engagement metrics, the younger the user the better the performance.”KY P.40, PARA 125 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT][internal TikTok group studying issues affecting TikTok]“Tiktok is particularly popular with younger users who are particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social reward and have minimal ability to self-regulate effectively.”KY P. 55, PARA 181 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]Activate & Engage users with the right content at the right time, to encourage users to open the App more and stay longer.”activate users so they will return to the app.KY P. 67, PARA 223 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]TikTok’s success can largely be attributed to strong out of the box personalization and automation, which limits user agency“addiction and impulsive purchasing of virtual items,”“fully leaned in and immersed compared to other platforms.”  “the leading platform for Information Density” “algorithm and shorter video formats”  “create continuous cycles of engagement.”“can largely be attributed to strong . . . personalization and automation, which limits user agency” “product experience utiliz[ing] many coercive design tactics,”[i]nfinite scroll, auto-play, constant notifications,” “the ‘slot machine’ effect”“can be considered manipulative.”“particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social award,”“minimal ability to self-regulate effectively,”“do not have executive function to control their screen time.” “TikTok is in most people’s lives like this,” “go on tiktok for 5 mins and 3 hours have passed” and “my night routine: watch 3 hours of tiktok videos, try to follow the dance steps, realise u suck at dancing n cry about it, continue watching tiktok videos, sleep.”TikTok is particularly popular with younger users, who are seen as more vulnerable to online harms and the negative impacts of compulsive use.” “negative emotions,” “interfered with [users’] obligations and productivity,” and led to “negative impacts . . . on their lives,”  “lost sleep, missed deadlines, poor school performance, running late, etc.” “many participants described their use of TikTok disturbing their sleep, which limited their productivity and performance the following day,”  “[e]very participant indicated that time management on TikTok was especially difficult compared to other social media platforms.”“feeling like they are trapped in a rabbit hole of what our algorithm thinks they like.”“Persuasive design strategies exploit the natural human desire to be social and popular, by taking advantage of an individual’s fear of not being social and popular in order to extend their online use. For young people, identity requires constant attention, curation and renewal. At key development stages it can be overwhelmingly important to be accepted by your peer group.”[These are the main harms we focused on in The Anxious Generation, although as you can see in the other four clusters, the harms caused by TikTok go far beyond mental health problems.]KY P. 60, PARA 196 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“offering effects that perpetuate a narrow beauty norm . .. ha[s] the potential to negatively impact the wellbeing of our community.”KY P. 65, PARA 213 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT][internal TikTok group studying issues affecting TikTok]“compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety.compulsive usage also interferes with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”KY P. 84, PARA 260 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]After following several ‘painhub’ and ‘sadnotes’ accounts, it took me 20 mins to drop into ‘negative’ filter bubble. The intensive density of negative content makes me lower down mood and increase my sadness feelings though I am in a high spirit in my recent life.”“there are a lot of videos mentioning suicide,”  “If you could kill yourself without hurting anybody would you?”KY P. 98, PARA 309-310 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]309. Defendants know these R1 reviews do not catch a great deal of content that violates the Community Guidelines or restrict content to age-appropriate groups.For example, a presentation about suicide and self-harm content moderation notes that R1 Moderators do not always speak the language shown in the videos, that moderators do not understand context, and that moderators are not given policy reminders for new instructions.[No direct quotes from TikTok employees, but see pages 36-43 for a section of the brief that describes the videos that were sent to fictitious accounts created by the AG’s office, pretending to be 13, 15, and 17 year old Nebraska residents. “Within minutes of scrolling through TikTok’s “For You” feed—before the accounts had searched for any videos or “followed” any users—TikTok’s algorithm repeatedly exposed each Nebraska teen account to overtly mature and otherwise inappropriate content.” Some of the videos sent to young girls—just on the basis of their age and gender—clearly encouraged young girls to starve themselves.]Some of the videos also clearly celebrate suicide as the way to escape from psychological pain.contentaccessedrecommendedusersKY P. 38, PARA 115 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]46.5% sexualized and drug content shared by WSJ is not covered by [the existing moderation] policy (ANSA 55%, Drug 24%).”“[t]he moderation leakage rate of sexualized and drug content is 73.5% (ANSA 58%, Drug 90%).”“most prevalent policy titles are sexually explicit language and mention of drugs,”implicit language [e.g., coded language] is often used in videos and failed to be captured [sic] by moderators.”KY P. 53, PARA 168 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“Minors Easily Access Livestream Feed”“[n]o age-related feed strategy.”“[o]ne of our key discoveries during this project that has turned into a major challenge with Live business is that the content that gets the highest engagement may not be the content we want on our platform. Transactional sexual content incorporates hundreds of signals that inform the [algorithm] as well as LiveOps metrics of success - # of gifts, frequency of hosts going live, # of comments, etc.”KY P.106, PARA 341 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“Normalization of Pedophilia”“Minor Sexual Solicitation”“leading minors off platform”“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”TikTok also knows that LIVE is being used for money laundering and other criminal activities.[TikTok has a virtual currency system where users can “gift” one another]. “sexually suggestive LIVE content is on the rise,”“make better use of monetization methods such as gifting and subscription to gain revenue . . . .”The Division’s presuit investigation also confirmed that TikTok’s platform facilitates the sale of illegal drugs to underage children right here at our doorstep—including easily allowing TikTok users to offer the sale and delivery of drugs like Xanax, Valium, and MDMA to children in Salt Lake City.“becoming more prevalent”“the majority didn’t violate guidelines” “the [TikTok] app doesn’t differentiate between videos it serves to adults and minors.”[See pages 35-36 and 43-50 for a section of the brief that describes the videos that were sent almost immediately to fictitious accounts created by the AG’s office, pretending to be 13, 15, and 17 year old Nebraska minors. Some of the videos are adult porn actresses engaging in lewd and obscene behavior on TikTok, in order to lure customers over to their Onlyfans pages, sometimes via Instagram.]“shouldn’t see mature or complex themes, such as: [p]rofanity[, s]exually suggestive content[, r]ealistic violence or threatening imagery[, f]irearms or weapons in an environment that isn’t appropriate[, i]llegal or controlled substances/drugs[, and e]xplicit references to mature or complex themes that may reflect personal experiences or real-world events that are intended for older audiences.” [But they do, as you can see in the leakage rates found in KY P. 106, PARA 341]Federal law mandates that Defendants report suspected CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (“NCMEC”) under 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. To limit and avoid its reporting requirements under federal law, Defendants purposely designed TikTok—which it knows are used by children, including children under 13—not to incorporate modern CSAM detection technology. This technology would be free for Defendants to implement within TikTok’s product design.PARA 113: While Defendants have stepped up their reporting to NCMEC [National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]—reporting 362,108 reports in the last half of 2023—these efforts illustrate how wantonly negligent TikTok has been historically, with only 596 reports made in 2019 and 22,692 in 2020. Defendants’ disregard for the safety of Young Users on TikTok has endangered countless children, including children in Kentucky.KY P. 100, PARA 316 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“[u]sers are more likely to post comments than videos,”“42% [of users] are ‘comment only’ users[.]”“Comments are increasing and manual coverage is disproportionately low.” “[h]uman moderation for comment review is at 0.25%.” “we’ve created an environment that encourages sexual content.”“enable[d the] exploitation of live hosts”In response to the Forbes article, TikTok also conducted a formal investigation into issues on LIVE called “Project Meramec.” TikTok shared the results of the investigation internally during a May 2022 “Safety Summit”:PARA 116: Project Meramec confirmed that young users well under the minimum age requirement could host LIVE sessions on TikTok. The study confirmed that in just the month of January 2022 alone, 112,000 “L1” users (i.e., a metric TikTok uses to categorize users between 13 and 15 years old) hosted LIVE sessions.“[H]igher proportion[s] of minor users”;“Minor users are more likely to access high severity risk LIVE content than adult users”;For violating content like “[a]dult nudity and sexual activities (ANSA) . . . and minor-hosted LIVE rooms, minor views are likely 2 times higher than other LIVE rooms”; “Minor users lack self-protection awareness and interact more with risky LIVE content.”In February 2022, two TikTok leaders discussed the need to remove “egregious content from clearly commercial sexual solicitation accounts,” and were aware of issues with women and minors being sexually solicited through LIVE.PARA 112: these leaders knew about agencies that recruited minors to create Child Sexual Abuse Material and commercialized it using LIVE.“streamer-led sexual engagements (often transactional) [were] commonly associated with TikTok LIVE.”“often seeing cam-girls or prostitutes asking viewers for tips/donations to take off their clothes or write their names on their body . . . .”“good amount of minors engaging in it.”  “a lot of nudity and soft porn.”  “perpetrators tend to use tactics such as gift giving, flattery, and gifting money to win the trust of minors.”In September 2022—five months after the Forbes story—an investigator found that “within minutes of browsing the [LIVE] feed” they were shown underage girls providing sexually suggestive content in exchange for money and young boys using filters to pose as girls to receive Gifts.PARA 126: The investigator also found a “never-ending stream” of hosts who openly admitted that they were 14 and 15 years old while also “holding signs” or “standing in front of the camera” with a sign saying “Rose = say daddy,” “ice cream = 360 spin,” or “universe = cut shirt.”TikTok LIVEregularlyKY P. 93, PARA 288 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“goal is not to reduce the time spent”“contribute to DAU [daily active users] and retention” KY P. 93, PARA 289 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“we don’t expect significant impact to stay time with this feature since it is only improving awareness and is not an intervention.”“minors do not have executive function to control their screen time.”KY P. 95, PARA 297, [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“provide users with educational resources about image disorders; create a campaign “to raise awareness on issues with low self esteem (caused by the excessive filter use and other issues)”; and add “a banner/H5 page to these filters and/or short videos which make use of the filters, particularly the Bold Glamour one, including an awareness statement about filters and the importance of positive body image/mental health, [that] could potentially minimize the negative public perception surrounding beauty filters and their reported effect on user mental health.”PARA 123: But raising the minimum age from 16 to 18 did nothing to solve the problem. TikTok’s age-gating is ineffective, and many kids still join LIVE events daily. TikTok also chose to forgo reasonable safety measures, prioritizing profits over safety, allowing unrestrained transactional sexual content and other illicit activities to thrive.‘teens in overtly sexualized situations on live streams controlled by someone older than 18 who is collecting money from viewers while the teen performs sexually suggestive acts.’ “Minors are more curious and prone to ignore warnings”“Without meaningful age verification methods, minors would typically just lie about their age.”“such a huge part of the strategy for the [TikTok app]” “reasonably expect to increase limitations for LIVE”  “it is irresponsible [of TikTok] to expect that users will use LIVE wisely.”PARA 120: In other words, LIVE was too profitable to be interfered with, even to protect children.These policies do not adequately safeguard children and, furthermore, are not consistently applied. In 2020, TikTok unveiled an ‘internal program’ to ‘protect creators and other accounts that [TikTok] deem to be high value.’ The program featured policy shortcuts like ‘delayed enforcement,’ ‘deferred policy decisions,’ or ‘no permanent ban on Elite + Accounts,’ to protect its popular users who violate TikTok’s policies. TikTok deployed this look-the-other-way policy despite knowing that the ‘majority of elite accounts appear to run afoul of [TikTok’s] policies on sexually explicit content,’ among other violations. Approximately 1,400 minors were considered ‘elite creators.’“a lot of the users, especially top users, are under 13,” “those kids will anyway say they are over 13.”“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing” “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy.“we don’t want to [make changes] to the For You feed because it’s going to decrease engagement,” “it could actually help people with screen time management.”“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems”  “not a priority for any other team.”“[w]e found out through some research that they’re not altogether effective” “it’s good as a point to share with policymakers, ‘cause they’re kind of impressed that we’re spending time, money, and energy to get people off our platform, at least in theory.”“not . . . at expense of retention.”not to reduce the time spent” “improve user experience and satisfaction”contribute to DAU [Daily Active Users] and retention.” “[t]his aligns with leadership’s guidance” “no impact to retention.”I’ve tried to quit but I just can’t do it,I can’t quit because then I won’t know what everyone else is talking abouttrappedKori James saidrecent studymost students were willing to pay to have that happenconducted a nationally representative surveyWhat, then, is the net value of TikTok to society? The harms are vast and varied, and they are hitting children, teens, and young adults the hardest, which means that TikTok may be altering developmental pathways and causing lasting changes. The net value is likely very negative. We believe that America would be much better off if TikTok were to go dark on January 19th.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Guiding an LLM for Robust Java ByteBuffer Code</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/14-guiding-llm-java-bytebuffer.html</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI editors like Cursor can generate code with remarkable speed using

But at scale, this becomes a surprisingly complex distributed systems problem.Imagine millions of users liking posts simultaneously, especially during . The system must remain , , and , even under heavy load.How do we handle  that receive massive, sudden traffic?How do we maintain  in likes count across distributed nodes?How do we ensure  and  as the number of like events scales into the millions?How do we make sure each user’s like is counted ?In this article, we’ll walk through how to design a scalable like-counting system starting from a basic design and gradually evolving it into a robust, distributed architecture.Along the way, we’ll explore important system design concepts and trade-offs, including:Strong vs. Eventual ConsistencyDeduplication (Idempotency)We’ll also discuss how to support , and how to build features like  using the like stream for real-time analytics.Before we jump into the design, let’s define what our “likes” system needs to support, both functionally and non-functionally.1. Functional RequirementsUsers can  and  a post by toggling the like button.A user can like a post . If they press “like” again, it should be treated as an .Both the post owner and viewers should be able to see the  for a post.The like count should update  after a like/unlike action.Show a full list of all users who liked a post.2. Non-Functional Requirements The system should handle thousands of likes per second, including spikes from viral content (say a celebrity’s post).The system must be horizontally scalable (able to add servers/nodes to handle growth): A failure in one component should not bring down the whole “likes” functionality. Liking a post should feel . The displayed count can lag slightly but should stay reasonably up to date. We aim for  — brief discrepancies in counts are acceptable, but they must reconcile quickly.  is nice-to-have, not a must. No likes should be lost, even during failures. Every like must be recorded persistently. A user’s like should count only once, even if the action is retried or duplicated. The system should support analytics use cases like identifying  (e.g., most-liked posts in the last hour).With these in mind, let’s begin with a simple solution and then evolve it into a scalable architecture by addressing each limitation.1. Basic Single-Database DesignLet’s start with the most straightforward solution — storing likes in a single relational database.We create a  table with columns like:(optional)  (auto-incremented)Every time a user likes a post, we insert a new row into this table.To get the total likes for a post, we simply run:SELECT COUNT(1) FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X;Alternatively, we could maintain a  field in a  table and increment it on every like.But for simplicity, let’s stick to querying the  table directly.On unlike, we can simply delete the corresponding row from the  table.DELETE FROM Likes WHERE post_id = 123 AND user_id = 'user_456';This approach also allows us to easily retrieve the list of users who liked a specific post using a simple query:SELECT user_id FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X;To optimize read queries, we can add an on, which improves lookup performance as the table grows.This setup is a typical monolith or simple web stack: Handles "like" requests from users. Stores each like action in the  tableWhen a user likes a post, the likes service inserts a record into the database. When someone views a post, it queries the total likes from the same database.Simplicity and Strong Consistency: Once the DB insert is successful, any subsequent reads will reflect the updated count. Everyone, the liker and other users sees the updated value immediately.Enforces Uniqueness Easily: We can add a  constraint to ensure that each user can only like a post once. If a user tries to like the same post again, the DB will reject it.Checking whether a user liked a post is a fast lookup on .SELECT 1 FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X AND user_id = Y;Every like triggers a write. With millions of users, the DB quickly becomes a bottleneck. A single SQL database can’t handle that level of write throughput.Using  on large tables is slow. As posts gain millions of likes, counting them becomes a performance problem — even with indexing.Each like inserts a row. Each post view might run a  query. Under load, these operations can slow down the system significantly.If the database goes down, users can’t like posts or see updated counts.Limited Horizontal Scaling: You can add read replicas to spread reads, but writes still go to the primary database. Scaling vertically (more CPU/RAM) only goes so far.This design is , offering  and . But it falls apart at scale.To handle real-world traffic with millions of users and viral posts, we need to evolve this architecture to improve performance, scalability, and availability.2. Improving Read Efficiency – Caching and Aggregated CountsIn our basic design, reading the like count with  is expensive and hits the database hard — especially for popular posts. To fix this, we introduce two improvements:Maintain precomputed like countsUse caching for fast readsInstead of computing the count on every read, we store it alongside the post. This can be done by:Adding a  column in the  table, orCreating a separate  table with schema: Each time a user likes or unlikes a post, we  this count. This turns a costly  query into a fast primary-key lookup.We add an in-memory cache (e.g.,  or ) to store frequently accessed like counts:The app checks the cache first.If the data isn’t in the cache (cache miss), it queries the DB, then stores the result in cache.Subsequent reads for the same post hit the cache, not the DB.(a distributed in-memory cache cluster) Stores  pairs in memory for fast access. Stores aggregated like counts in either the  table or a dedicated table.Insert a row into the  table.Increment the  in the  or  table.UPDATE Posts SET like_count = like_count + 1 WHERE post_id = XIf both the like insertion and count update are in the same DB, we can wrap them in a  for strong consistency.BEGIN;

-- 1. Insert into Likes table
INSERT INTO Likes (post_id, user_id, timestamp)
VALUES (123, 'user_456', NOW());

-- 2. Increment like count
UPDATE Posts
SET like_count = like_count + 1
WHERE post_id = 123;

COMMIT;Invalidate or update the cache entry for that post’s count.We still need the  table to log all the like events and find users who liked a post.On cache miss, query for  from  table, then populate the cache.SELECT like_count FROM WHERE post_id = X Fetching the like count is now  — either from cache or via a quick primary-key lookup. No more expensive aggregations over many rows. Cache absorbs most read traffic, especially for viral posts that are viewed repeatedly.Strong Consistency (for a single server): A transactional write ensures that the  row and the  update stay in sync. We’re caching a single number (the count), which is easy to update or invalidate on write. When the like count changes in the DB, the cache needs to be updated or invalidated. Otherwise, clients may be shown stale data. A common pattern is: 1. Update DB
2. Invalidate cacheWrite Contention on Hot Posts: Now every like involves two writes (insert in the  table + update in the  table). For popular posts, the  row can become a hotspot, causing lock contention in the DB. (We will address this later with sharding and other techniques.): All likes still go through the same DB instance. While reads are faster, we haven’t solved write scalability yet.Eventual Consistency in Caches: If using read replicas or multiple cache layers, some clients may see slightly stale counts due to replication lag or delayed cache updates. Usually acceptable within a short window (milliseconds to seconds). Storing every post’s count in cache uses memory. Fortunately, the data size is small, and infrequently accessed entries (e.g. old posts) can be evicted.Despite the drawbacks, this step significantly improves read performance. Instead of recalculating likes for every view, we cache or store the count and serve it instantly.But the write path is still centralized, and hot posts can create contention. To scale further, we need to distribute the write workload — which we’ll explore next.3.

I’m Dane, the creator of Plandex (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex), an open source AI coding agent focused especially on tackling large tasks in real world software projects.Now I’m launching a major update, Plandex v2, which is the result of 8 months of heads down work, and is in effect a whole new project/product.In short, Plandex is now a top-tier coding agent with fully autonomous capabilities. It combines models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to achieve better results, more reliable agent behavior, better cost efficiency, and better performance than is possible by using only a single provider’s models.I believe it is now one of the best tools available for working on large tasks in real world codebases with AI. It has an effective context window of 2M tokens, and can index projects of 20M tokens and beyond using tree-sitter project maps (30+ languages are supported). It can effectively find relevant context in massive million-line projects like SQLite, Redis, and Git.A bit more on some of Plandex’s key features:- Plandex has a built-in diff review sandbox that helps you get the benefits of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project. By default, all changes accumulate in the sandbox until you approve them. The sandbox is version-controlled. You can rewind it to any previous point, and you can also create branches to try out alternative approaches.- It offers a ‘full auto mode’ that can complete large tasks autonomously end-to-end, including high level planning, context loading, detailed planning, implementation, command execution (for dependencies, builds, tests, etc.), and debugging.- The autonomy level is highly configurable. You can move up and down the ladder of autonomy depending on the task, your comfort level, and how you weigh cost optimization vs. effort and results.- Models and model settings are also very configurable. There are built-in models and model packs for different use cases. You can also add custom models and model packs, and customize model settings like temperature or top-p. All model changes are version controlled, so you can use branches to try out the same task with different models. The newly released OpenAI models and the paid Gemini 2.5 Pro model will be integrated in the default model pack soon.- It can be easily self-hosted, including a ‘local mode’ for a very fast local single-user setup with Docker.- Cloud hosting is also available for added convenience with a couple of subscription tiers: an ‘Integrated Models’ mode that requires no other accounts or API keys and allows you to manage billing/budgeting/spending alerts and track usage centrally, and a ‘BYO API Key’ mode that allows you to use your own OpenAI/OpenRouter accounts.And of course I’d love to hear your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks so much!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI Debuts Codex CLI, an Open Source Coding Tool For Terminals</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/16/1931240/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has released Codex CLI, an open-source coding agent that runs locally in users' terminal software. Announced alongside the company's new o3 and o4-mini models, Codex CLI directly connects OpenAI's AI systems with local code and computing tasks, enabling them to write and manipulate code on users' machines. 

The lightweight tool allows developers to leverage multimodal reasoning capabilities by passing screenshots or sketches to the model while providing access to local code repositories. Unlike more ambitious future plans for an "agentic software engineer" that could potentially build entire applications from descriptions, Codex CLI focuses specifically on integrating AI models with command-line interfaces. 

To accelerate adoption, OpenAI is distributing $1 million in API credits through a grant program, offering $25,000 blocks to selected projects. While the tool expands AI's role in programming workflows, it comes with inherent risks -- studies show AI coding models frequently fail to fix security vulnerabilities and sometimes introduce new bugs, particularly concerning when given system-level access.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Man who built ISP instead of paying Comcast expands to hundreds of homes (2022)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/man-who-built-isp-instead-of-paying-comcast-50k-expands-to-hundreds-of-homes/</link><author>voxadam</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:06:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making DNSimple (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/637</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/637/the-changelog-637.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anthony Eden, Founder & CEO of DNSimple, joins the show to talk about the world of managed hosting for DNS and more.Changelog++ members save 9 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

Assume that free will is real, not an illusion, and that the only reality is physical. How then could the will possibly be free? By what mechanism could human choice transcend the strong determinism of a closed physical world? One can try diminishing one side or the other: reducing free will or softening determinism, but each has its own difficulties.

Viewer discretion is strongly advised.

As Allied forces pushed deeper into Nazi-held territory in the spring of 1945, they would uncover scenes that defied imagination. Among these was a place whose name would become synonymous with unspeakable suffering and cruelty the world over, revealing the depths of human depravity and the monumental scale of horror wrought by the Nazi regime; Bergen-Belsen.

Without the extensive photo and video evidence taken following the camps liberation, no one could have conceived of the horrors that happened within the walls of Bergen-Belsen. Images of intense human suffering would shake the world to its core, and to this day remain some of the starkest reminders, of the one of the darkest chapters in human history.

They made this commitment more than 20 years ago. But even today, more than a million minors are still working on cocoa plantations. How is this possible?

In 2002, the chocolate industry made a contractual commitment to ban child labor on cocoa plantations within five years. We want to know: are companies honoring this commitment? Many chocolate manufacturers stand for fair trade and sustainability -- and against child labor. But as the film shows, often the fancy labels on chocolate packaging are just empty promises.

In Ivory Coast, for example, children still toil on cocoa plantations - with the simplest of tools, and without protective clothing, although they handle pesticides - for many hours every day. Often, they’re not the farmers’ children, but ‘slave children’ sent as laborers by desperate families in Mali or Burkina Faso because they’re no longer able to feed them.

But there are some small rays of hope: In the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic promotes fair organic farming. There is barely any child labor in this island nation and cocoa farmers can expect a fair income. Although the Caribbean produces just two per cent of global cocoa, it’s an example of what can be done.

The film also shows that sometimes, companies are unaware of conditions on the plantations, as practices are concealed by the middlemen. And that in some countries, little has changed since the signing of the protocol to end child labor in the cocoa industry.

What is it about science and theology that grips people so emotionally, as during a war, such that each is committed to his or her viewpoint (which often are sharply opposed to one another)? Each is fighting for its predominance, if not for its life: religion from being marginalized, science from being politically contained.

One of the great things about Darwin is that a huge amount of his work is digitized and freely available via sites like Darwin Online.Interested browsers can also check out the Darwin Manuscripts Project, a collaborative initiative based at the American Museum of Natural History. Here you can read through Darwin’s personal notes, including gems like his scratched out book title ideas. There are also a number of nature drawings that Darwin prepared while writing his masterpiece, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859). Here, for example, is Darwin’s rather skillful drawing of the stamen of a  flower:But there are other drawings in Darwin’s papers that defy explanation - until we remember that Darwin and his wife Emma (who, famously, was also his cousin) had a huge family of ten children. Scholars believe that a young Francis Darwin, the naturalist’s third oldest son, drew this on the back of Darwin’s manuscript for .
    “The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers”
    Remarkably, this is one of only twenty-eight pages of the manuscript that still exist. The Cambridge University Library has given it the descriptive name “The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers,” and so indeed it seems to be. As near as I can make out, it shows a turbaned soldier mounted on a blueberry squaring off with an English dragoon on a carrot-steed. Perhaps inspired by the 1839-1842 Anglo-Afghan War, and filtered through the Darwin household’s fascination with plants and gardening?Here’s another drawing from the talented Darwin children, this one seemingly directly inspired by their father’s work. Birds are in the act of catching a spider and a gnat or bee, while flowers and a butterfly appear in remarkable detail. Clearly the family had a knack for acute observations of nature (in fact young Francis ended up becoming a naturalist as well).This one’s my personal favorite: a child’s-eye view of the Darwin family home with cozy details like a tea kettle on the boil and a fluffy orange cat in the attic window.Fascinatingly, this image might be detailed enough that it actually depicts Darwin’s famous sandwalk, his “thinking path” that led to the family greenhouse (which is, perhaps, the structure visible at the end of the path). The area was later made into a playground for the Darwin children.I poked around the items available at Darwin Online and came across Emma Darwin’s diaries, which are a fascinating resource. Emma seems to have been a talented sketch artist in her own right, doodling profiles and faces in over her daily schedule:Here’s another, perhaps a self-portrait? Write us on Twitter or Facebook if you have any ideas as to whether this is Emma’s self-portrait or a drawing of another family member.Amazingly, the Darwin kids even got into Emma’s diary, with several pages rendered unreadable by what is almost certainly a crazed toddler’s pencil. In fact, the back page of Emma’s potential self-portrait was defaced in precisely this way:
    Francis Darwin strikes again?
    It’s all a great reminder that even legendary scientists had family lives, and that when we think about history, it’s important to remember that famous figures weren’t working in isolation. They were surrounded by far less famous friends, family members, acquaintances, and enemies. And sometimes, when we get lucky, we see some of their artifacts from the past too.A tip of the hat, by the way, to Open Culture, a website that we’re avid fans of and which wrote the original post about the Darwin kids’ drawings that brought them to our attention. Also be sure to check out Darwin Online and the Darwin Manuscripts Project, two wonderful resources for anyone interested in the naturalist and his times.I also wanted to include a short note on Annie Darwin, who died from tuberculosis at age ten and was Charles’ favorite child (or so he told his cousin). This box of items relating to Annie’s life that was collected by Emma Darwin offers another, sadder testimony to the tight-knit dynamic of the Darwin family, and to their artistic knack. Annie’s pink flowers in careful needlepoint seem to echo the exuberant nature drawings of her siblings:
    The Darwins’ box of mementos relating to Annie’s life.
    Darwin wrote about Annie after her death with touching earnestness as he tried to set down his memories of her before they faded:Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower St on March 2d. 1841. & expired at Malvern at1 Midday on the 23d. of April 1851.— I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live, the impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief characteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main feature in her disposition which at once rises before me is her buoyant joyousness.
    Darwin’s memoir of Annie in his personal papers.
    In his book Annie’s Box: Charles Darwin, His Daughter And Human Evolution, Randal Keynes argues that Darwin’s scientific thought was closely entangled with his family life, and that the death of Annie just before Easter in 1851 spelled the end of Darwin’s already weakening Christian faith. Students of the past are often leery of making overly explicit and binary links between work and life (I remember being amazed when I learned that Shakespeare’s son Hamnet died several years before he wrote  and that literary scholars don’t make more hay with that fact). But if nothing else, it again reminds us that when historical figures become legendary icons, they lose much of the context that makes them human to us at the remove of decades or centuries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A single shot changed history forever #AmericanRevolutionPBS #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA0qvIxGAs8</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oA0qvIxGAs8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:04:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A single shot echoes on Lexington Green, and the American Revolution begins.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION examines how America’s founding turned the world upside-down. Thirteen British colonies on the Atlantic Coast rose in rebellion, won their independence, and established a new form of government that radically reshaped the continent and inspired centuries of democratic movements around the globe.

An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war. 

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Costco’s Co-Founder Said ‘No’ to Kirkland Gas 8 Times | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RrIgCy6y4g</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9RrIgCy6y4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Costco’s co-founder Jim Sinegal sat down with The Wall Street Journal, discussing how he built the $86 billion Kirkland Signature private label, why he was so reluctant to get into the gasoline business and what made him leave FedMart and The Price Club after nearly three decades.

There’s a town in Florida where the sun seems to always shine. Where the clouds almost always blow past before they turn to rain. A city with the Guinness World Record for consecutive sunny days, where the local newspaper was willing to bet against the weather by giving a free paper out whenever the sun didn’t shine. And spoiler alert: they didn’t give out that many.

That city is St. Petersburg, Florida — and for the most part, it actually lives up to its reputation. In the average year it gets 361 days of sunshine, which sounds impossible in the wet and rainy state of Florida. But St. Pete exists in what we call a meteorological goldilocks zone. So what exactly is it that makes this Florida city so damn sunny? Check out Vox Video's latest to find out.

ABSTRACT
When programming these days it’s easy to forget the many layers of abstractions between what you type and what the computer you run your code on is actually doing.
In this talk, Matt will describe some of the performance features of modern CPUs and explain how your code is already benefiting from them. We’ll look at real-world server performance, the tooling available to measure their impact, and how compilers are often already doing the right thing for us.

By the end of the talk you’ll appreciate the amazing work of chip designers and compiler authors, but you’ll also know how to diagnose when things go awry, and what to do about it. [...]

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, 2 university students decided to build a meme generator.Yet their business idea failed.So they pivoted to create a design tool for the browser and called it Figma.They stored metadata such as file information and user comments in a  database for simplicity.Yet their traffic was massive.And it affected latency and performance because of high CPU usage.So they  by installing Postgres on a larger machine. It means more CPU.Although it temporarily solved their scalability issue, there were new problems.Some tables grew extremely fast.While smallest unit of partition is a table.So a single database couldn’t handle their storage needs.They received a ton of write operations.It exceeded the input-output per second () limit of a single database. So the performance became poor.Ship and scale production grade apps at a blistering pace with GibsonAI, your AI-powered serverless database. With GibsonAI, you will:Design your database with natural language and view it as a diagram (ERD) & code.Deploy both dev and production environments in seconds with one click.Access your database directly or through the secure REST API built for you.Instruct GibsonAI to build, query, or update databases right from your favorite IDE via the GibsonAI MCP server.Migrations, optimization and scaling handled for you.Here’s how they scaled Postgres step by step:They set up database replicas and  towards it.Reduce latency by keeping data closer to users around the worldIncrease fault tolerance as replicas could take over when the leader database failsYet replicas couldn’t handle some read operations because of replication lag and strong consistency needs. So they route those operations to the leader database.Besides they added a caching layer to store frequently accessed data, thus reducing the database load.They moved tables into separate databases based on the domain.Scale horizontally by adding more databasesSpread workload across databases and reduce bottlenecksFor example, they store file information and user comments in separate databases because file information grows faster than comments. While the workload is different for each table.Ready for the next technique?They set up PgBouncer as the connection pooler.It acts as a TCP proxy holding a pool of connections to Postgres.And the client connects directly to PgBouncer instead of Postgres.Allow clients to reuse the same connection and improve throughputLimit the number of database connections to avoid connection starvationKeep persistent connections with the client to avoid expensive reconnection requestsThey moved columns from high-traffic tables into separate tables. And then stored those tables in different databases.Yet each table has its own database. Put simply, a single table doesn’t spread across many databases.Isolate sensitive data for securityReduce workload by routing traffic across many databasesAchieve high query performance by scanning only a subset of dataYet vertical partitioning becomes a bottleneck with high write traffic. Because a single database wouldn’t be able to store a table with billions of rows.5. Horizontal PartitioningThey split tables at the row level and stored them across many databases for maximum scalability.Also they set up a  to route queries to the correct database.Rewrite expensive queries for performanceManage database topology and support transactionsDrop extra requests when it exceed the threshold limitThey used the hash of the partition key to route write requests. Thus distributing data uniformly across databases.Besides they co-located tables partitioned by the same key to make transactions and joins easier.Figma became a popular design tool with over 40 million users.This case study shows Postgres can easily handle internet-scale traffic.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’ll launch system design deep dives in this newsletterYet it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of the newsletterMy mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Sheryl Lee Ralph's third great grandparents, a mixed race couple, got married in 1837. Her third great grandfather Hugh, a white man, left his estate to Mary, a mixed race woman. This circumstance would have been a rarity for 1800s Jamaica.

In 2022, Sheryl Lee Ralph won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of “Barbara Howard,” Abbott’s veteran Kindergarten teacher, on ABC’s hit comedy series “Abbott Elementary.” She was nominated again for the second and third seasons of the series. On stage, she is well known for her award-winning work and creating the role of “Deena Jones” in the legendary Broadway musical “Dreamgirls,” which earned her Best Actress nods for Tony and Drama Desk Awards. Ralph made her feature film debut at 20 years-old opposite Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier in Warner Bros. A Piece of the Action, which Poitier also directed. Other notable roles include Mistress with Robert de Niro, To Sleep with Anger with Danny Glover, and The Distinguished Gentlemen with Eddie Murphy, Sister Act 2 with Whoopi Goldberg, “Moesha,” and “Ray Donovan.”

These assemblers tend to be poorly documented, provide languages that are clunky and verbose, be bloated and difficult to operate, or work only on one operating system. Development of C compilers is often a higher priority than the development of good assemblers.Instead of learning a new assembler for every platform, it would be preferrable to instead use a single general-purpose assembler for every project. Torque was created to fill this niche.Torque is designed around the idea that any assembly language can be emulated with just integers, bit sequences, labels, and sufficiently powerful macros. With Torque, the instruction encoding for a target processor can be defined as a set of macros in the program itself, using templates to specify how values are packed into ranges of bits. A program can be written for any processor using only Torque and the datasheet for that processor.The latest release is available at tq-2.3.0 as a pre-compiled Linux executable.To build the Torque assembler from source, first install the Rust compiler from www.rust-lang.org/tools/install, then install the nightly toolchain with rustup toolchain install nightly, and then run cargo +nightly build --release inside the  source code directory.The compiled binary will be created at .The following command will assemble the Torque source file  and save the assembled output to the file  in the chosen format.tq [source] [destination] --format=<format>

The letter tells Lovable to stop using the term "Dev Mode" for a new product feature. Figma, which also has a feature called Dev Mode, successfully trademarked that term last year, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. What's wild is that "dev mode" is a common term used in many products that cater to software programmers. It's like an edit mode. Software products from giant companies like Apple's iOS, Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Xbox have features formally called "developer mode" that then get nicknamed "dev mode" in reference materials.
 
Even "dev mode" itself is commonly used. For instance Atlassian used it in products that pre-date Figma's copyright by years. And it's a common feature name in countless open source software projects. Figma tells TechCrunch that its trademark refers only to the shortcut "Dev Mode" -- not the full term "developer mode." Still, it's a bit like trademarking the term "bug" to refer to "debugging." Since Figma wants to own the term, it has little choice but send cease-and-desist letters. (The letter, as many on X pointed out, was very polite, too.) If Figma doesn't defend the term, it could be absorbed as a generic term and the trademarked becomes unenforceable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You Should Still Learn To Code, Says GitHub CEO</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/15/1853254/you-should-still-learn-to-code-says-github-ceo?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:53:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You should still learn to code, says GitHub's CEO. And you should start as soon as possible. From a report: "I strongly believe that every kid, every child, should learn coding," Thomas Dohmke said in a recent podcast interview with EO. "We should actually teach them coding in school, in the same way that we teach them physics and geography and literacy and math and what-not." Coding, he added, is one such fundamental skill -- and the only reason it's not part of the curriculum is because it took "us too long to actually realize that." 

Dohmke, who's been a programmer since the 90s, said he's never seen "anything more exciting" than the current moment in engineering -- the advent of AI, he believes, has made the field that much easier to break into, and is poised to make software more ubiquitous than ever. "It's so much easier to get into software development. You can just write a prompt into Copilot or ChatGPT or similar tools, and it will likely write you a basic webpage, or a small application, a game in Python," Dohmke said. "And so, AI makes software development so much more accessible for anyone who wants to learn coding." 

AI, Dohmke said, helps to "realize the dream" of bringing an idea to life, meaning that fewer projects will end up dead in the water, and smaller teams of developers will be enabled to tackle larger-scale projects. Dohmke said he believes it makes the overall process of creation more efficient. "You see some of the early signs of that, where very small startups -- sometimes five developers and some of them actually only one developer -- believe they can become million, if not billion dollar businesses by leveraging all the AI agents that are available to them," he added.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4chan has been down since Monday night after “pretty comprehensive own”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/internet-cesspit-4chan-apparently-hacked-mostly-unreachable-since-monday-night/</link><author>Andrew Cunningham</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4chan-logo-1152x648.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:43:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Infamous Internet imageboard and wretched hive of scum and villainy 4chan was apparently hacked at some point Monday evening and remains mostly unreachable as of this writing.

Residents of these underserved neighborhoods are forced to live with violence and a lack of opportunities. But not everyone is willing to accept the situation.

In the areas known as the "Quartiers Nord" or "Northern Quarters" of Marseille, drug trafficking and gang wars are a part of everyday life. Drug-related violence has claimed dozens of lives in recent years and the French government has been unable to improve the situation, leaving residents in a hopeless situation. But Amine Kessaci wants to change that. The 21-year-old is the founder of an organization called Conscience. The group campaigns locally and citywide for better living conditions in these neighborhoods. It also supports families who have lost loved-ones to drug-related gang violence — something Amine has experienced himself.
Another ray of hope for these troubled districts is a converted firefighting bus that provides medical assistance. Doctor Slim Hadiji and his team offer preventive care and hold information events. They also make house calls and accompany patients to medical appointments. The initiative supports those who would otherwise receive little to no help.
Meanwhile, local football club FCL Malpassé is an important community hub and a safe haven for the children and young people living in these areas. The club's coaches are available around the clock. They hope their club can offer young people not just a safe place to go, but also a chance to improve their lives.

Consistently with on-line perceptual signal analysis, the EWMA gives more weight to recent input values, whereas the contributions of older values decay exponentially.
A compact, iterative formulation of the model affords computing an update at each signal input sample, requiring no buffering and involving only a handful of arithmetic operations.Each resonator, characterized by its resonant frequency \(f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\), is described by a complex number \(R\) whose amplitude captures the contribution of the input signal component around frequency \(f\).
The formulas below capture the recursive update for \(R\) by way of a phasor \(P\), applied for each sample \(x\) of a real-valued input signal \(x(t) \in [-1,1]\), regularly sampled at sampling rate \(sr\). \(\Delta t=1/sr\) is the sample duration, and \(\alpha \in [0,1]\) is a constant parameter that dictates how much each new measurement affects the accumulated value.

\[P \leftarrow P e^{-i \omega \Delta t}\]

\[R \leftarrow (1-\alpha) R + \alpha x P\]

The two complex numbers \(P\) and \(R\) capture the full state of the resonator. Updating the state at each input signal sample only requires a handful of arithmetic operations. Calculating the power and/or magnitude is not necessary for the update, and can be carried out only when required by the application, relatively efficiently as well.
The single parameter \(\alpha\), which can be related to a time constant, governs the dynamics of the system. For the frequency range of interest in audio applications (20-20000 Hz), the function \(\alpha_f = 1-e^{-\Delta t\frac{f}{log(1+f)} }\) is a reasonable heuristic.
The smoothed state \(\tilde{R}\) is produced by applying the EMWA to \(R\) with the same \(\alpha\) to dampen power and phase oscillations.
Finally, the output of each resonator is optionally normalized by the total response across the bank to a step signal of the resonator’s frequency (equalization).Banks of resonators, independently tuned to perceptually relevant frequency scales, compute an instantaneous, perceptually relevant estimate of the spectral content of an input signal in real-time.
Both memory and per-sample computational complexity of such a bank are linear in the number of resonators, and independent of the number of input samples processed, or duration of processed signal.
Furthermore, since the resonators are independent, there is no constraint on the tuning of their resonant frequencies or time constants, and all  computations can be parallelized across resonators.
In an offline processing context, the cumulative computational cost for a given duration increases linearly with the number of input samples processed.Spectral information as a function of time is typically presented graphically for human consumption in the form of a spectrogram, in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The value at each point represents the power of the frequency in the input signal at the given time slice. These values are usually normalized by the maximum value over the signal, and mapped to a logarithmic color scale to produce plots like those shown below.
A Resonate oscillator bank with adequately tuned resonators computes an arbitrary frequency scale spectrogram directly and efficiently, with more relevant frequency resolution and much higher temporal resolutiont than FFT-based methods.Alexandre R.J. François,

They state that the CA/B Forum has been telling the world for years, by steadily shortening maximum lifetimes, that automation is essentially mandatory for effective certificate lifecycle management.The ballot argues that shorter lifetimes are necessary for many reasons, the most prominent being this: The information in certificates is becoming steadily less trustworthy over time, a problem that can only be mitigated by frequently revalidating the information.The ballot also argues that the revocation system using CRLs and OCSP is unreliable. Indeed, browsers often ignore these features. The ballot has a long section on the failings of the certificate revocation system. Shorter lifetimes mitigate the effects of using potentially revoked certificates. In 2023, CA/B Forum took this philosophy to another level by approving short-lived certificates, which expire within 7 days, and which do not require CRL or OCSP support.Two points about the new rules are likely to cause confusion:The three years for the rule changes are 2026, 2027, and 2029, but the gap between the second set of years is two years long.As of March 15, 2029, the maximum lifetime for a TLS certificate will be 47 days, but the maximum period during which domain validation information may be reused is . Manual revalidation will still technically be possible, but doing so would be a recipe for failure and outages.As a certificate authority, one of the most common questions we hear from customers is whether they’ll be charged more to replace certificates more frequently. The answer is no. Cost is based on an annual subscription, and what we’ve learned is that, once users adopt automation, they often voluntarily move to more rapid certificate replacement cycles.For this reason, and because even the 2027 changes to 100-day certificates will make manual procedures untenable, we expect rapid adoption of automation long before the 2029 changes.Apple’s statement about automated certificate lifecycle management is indisputable, but it’s something we’ve been long preparing for. DigiCert offers multiple automation solutions through Trust Lifecycle Manager and CertCentral, including support for ACME. DigiCert’s ACME allows automation of DV, OV, and EV certificates and includes support for ACME Renewal Information (ARI).Get in touch for more information on how you can make the best use of automation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Earth in 2125 could look like - Iseult Gillespie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UJTtk_2ly0</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4UJTtk_2ly0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What could our future look like if we harness our technology to create a sustainable world?

It can be fun to be in opposition, to harangue or even to use power to change someone’s position.An argument, though, is an exchange of ideas that ought to surface insight and lead to a conclusion.If you’re regularly having arguments with well-informed people of goodwill, you will probably ‘lose’ half of them–changing your mind based on what you’ve learned. If you’re not changing your mind, it’s likely you’re not actually having an argument (or you’re hanging out with the wrong people.) While it can be fun to change someone else’s position, it’s also a gift to learn enough to change ours.The toddler puts on a show of having an argument, but they are holding a tantrum in reserve. If they ‘win’ the argument, no tantrum is needed. If they lose, they can tell themselves that they tried but the other person deserved the tantrum because they didn’t listen.“Tell me about other strongly-held positions you’ve changed as the result of a discussion like this one…” is a direct way to start a conversation about the argument you’re proposing to have. “What sort of information would make it likely you could see this in a different way?”It probably doesn’t pay to argue over things we have chosen to believe as part of our identity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three Key Ways Trump Can Cut Medicaid Funding | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQwkhpNhwho</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vQwkhpNhwho?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 14:01:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicaid covers more than 70 million low-income people in the U.S., the largest public health insurance program in the country.

75% of all new infectious diseases, like Ebola, AIDS, and COVID-19 come from animals. As we destroy forests and go deeper into wild habitats, we increase the risk of those diseases being transmitted to humans. This is how pandemics begin. 

Here’s how to reduce the risk of future pandemics: 

✔️ Limit unnecessary contact with wild animals 
✔️ Avoid eating wild or unknown animal meat 
✔️ Practice good hygiene, like washing your hands regularly and boiling drinking water 
✔️ Protect yourself against mosquito bites

By the time the war was over, U.S. science and engineering had blown past the British, and led the world for 85 years.It happened because two very different people were the science advisors to their nation’s leaders. Each had radically different views on how to use their country’s resources to build advanced weapon systems. Post war, it meant Britain’s early lead was ephemeral while the U.S. built the foundation for a science and technology innovation ecosystem that led the world – until now.The British – Military Weapons LabsWhen Winston Churchill became the British prime minister in 1940, he had at his side his science advisor, Professor Frederick Lindemann, his friend for 20 years. Lindemann headed up the physics department at Oxford and was the director of the Oxford Clarendon Laboratory. Already at war with Germany, Britain’s wartime priorities focused on defense and intelligence technology projects, e.g. weapons that used electronics, radar, physics, etc. – a radar-based air defense network called Chain Home, airborne radar on night fighters, and plans for a nuclear weapons program – the MAUD Committee which started the British nuclear weapons program code-named Tube Alloys. And their codebreaking organization at Bletchley Park was starting to read secret German messages – the Enigma – using the earliest computers ever built.As early as the mid 1930s, the British, fearing Nazi Germany, developed prototypes of these weapons using their existing military and government research labs. The Telecommunications Research Establishment built early-warning Radar, critical to Britain’s survival during the Battle of Britain, and electronic warfare to protect British bombers over Germany. The Admiralty Research Lab built Sonar and anti-submarine warfare systems. The Royal Aircraft Establishment was developing jet fighters. The labs then contracted with British companies to manufacture the weapons in volume. British government labs viewed their universities as a source of talent, but they had no role in weapons development.Under Churchill, Professor Lindemann influenced which projects received funding and which were sidelined. Lindemann’s WWI experience as a researcher and test pilot on the staff of the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough gave him confidence in the competence of British military research and development labs. His top-down, centralized approachprimarily in government research labs shaped British innovation during WW II – and led to its demise post-war.The Americans – University Weapons LabsUnlike Britain, the U.S. lacked a science advisor. It wasn’t until June 1940, that Vannevar Bush, ex-MIT dean of engineering, told President Franklin Roosevelt that World War II would be the first war won or lost on the basis of advanced technology electronics, radar, physics problems, etc.Unlike Lindemann, Bush had a 20-year-long contentious history with the U.S. Navy and a dim view of government-led R&D. Bush contended that the government research labs were slow and second rate. He convinced the President that while the Army and Navy ought to be in charge of making conventional weapons – planes, ships, tanks, etc. — scientists from academia could develop better advanced technology weapons and deliver them faster than Army and Navy research labs. And he argued the only way the scientists could be productive was if they worked in a university setting in  weapons labs run by university professors. To the surprise of the Army and Navy Service chiefs, Roosevelt agreed to let Bush build exactly that organization to coordinate and fund all advanced weapons .(While Bush had no prior relationship with the President, Roosevelt had been the Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I and like Bush had seen first-hand its dysfunction. Over the next four years they worked well together. Unlike Churchill, Roosevelt had little interest in science and accepted Bush’s opinions on the direction of U.S. technology programs, giving Bush sweeping authority.)In 1941, Bush upped the game by convincing the President that in addition to research, development, acquisition and deployment of these weapons also ought to be done by professors in universities. There they would be tasked to develop military weapons systems and solve military problems to defeat Germany and Japan. (The weapons were then manufactured in volume by U.S. corporations Western Electric, GE, RCA, Dupont, Monsanto, Kodak, Zenith, Westinghouse, Remington Rand and Sylvania.) To do this Bush created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSR&D).OSR&D headquarters divided the wartime work into 19 “divisions,” 5 “committees,” and 2 “panels,” each solving a unique part of the military war effort. There were no formal requirements.Staff at OSRD worked with their military liaisons to understand what the most important military problems were and then each OSR&D division came up with solutions. These efforts spanned an enormous range of tasks – the development of advanced electronics, radar, rockets, sonar, new weapons like the proximity fuse, Napalm, the Bazooka and new drugs such as penicillin, cures for malaria, chemical warfare, and nuclear weapons.Each  division was run by a professor hand-picked by Bush. And they were located in universities –  MIT, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Caltech, Columbia and the University of Chicago all ran major weapons systems programs. Nearly 10,000 scientists and engineers, professors and their grad students received draft deferments to work in these university labs.Americans – Unlimited DollarsWhat changed U.S. universities, and the world forever, was government money. Lots of it. Prior to WWII most advanced technology research in the U.S. was done in corporate innovation labs (GE, AT&T, Dupont, RCA, Westinghouse, NCR, Monsanto, Kodak, IBM, et al.) Universities had no government funding (except for agriculture) for research. Academic research had been funded by non-profits, mostly the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations and industry. Now, for the first time, U.S. universities were getting more money than they had ever seen. Between 1941 and 1945, OSR&D gave $9 billion (in 2025 dollars) to the top U.S. research universities. This made universities full partners in wartime research, not just talent pools for government projects as was the case in Britain.The British – Wartime ConstraintsWartime Britain had very different constraints. First, England was under daily attack. They were being bombed by air and blockaded by submarines, so it was logical that they focused on a smaller set of high-priority projects to counter these threats. Second, the country was teetering on bankruptcy. It couldn’t afford the broad and deep investments that the U.S. made. (Illustrated by their abandonment of their nuclear weapons programs when they realized how much it would cost to turn the research into industrial scale engineering.) This meant that many other areas of innovation—such as early computing and nuclear research—were underfunded compared to their American counterparts.Churchill was voted out of office in 1945. With him went Professor Lindemann and the coordination of British science and engineering. Britain would be without a science advisor until 1951-55 when Churchill returned for a second term and brought back Lindemann with him.The end of the war led to extreme downsizing of the British military including severe cuts to all the government labs that had developed Radar, electronics, computing, etc.With post-war Britain financially exhausted, post-war austerity limited its ability to invest in large-scale innovation. There were no post-war plans for government follow-on investments. The differing economic realities of the U.S. and Britain also played a key role in shaping their innovation systems. The United States had an enormous industrial base, abundant capital, and a large domestic market, which enabled large-scale investment in research and development. In Britain, a socialist government came to power. Churchill’s successor, Labor’s Clement Attlee, dissolved the British empire, nationalized banking, power and light, transport, and iron and steel, all which reduced competition and slowed technological progress.While British research institutions like Cambridge and Oxford remained leaders in theoretical science, they struggled to scale and commercialize their breakthroughs. For instance Alan Turing’s and Tommy Flower’s pioneering work on computing at Bletchley Park didn’t turn into a thriving British computing industry—unlike in the U.S., where companies like ERA, Univac, NCR and IBM built on their wartime work.Without the same level of government support for dual-use technologies or commercialization, and with private capital absent for new businesses, Britain’s post-war innovation ecosystem never took off.Meanwhile in the U.S. universities and companies realized that the wartime government funding for research had been an amazing accelerator for science, engineering, and medicine. Everyone, including Congress, agreed that the U.S. government should continue to play a large role in continuing it. In 1945, Vannevar Bush published a report “Science, The Endless Frontier” advocating for government funding of basic research in universities, colleges, and research institutes. Congress argued on how to best organize federal support of science.By the end of the war, OSR&D funding had taken technologies that had been just research papers or considered impossible to build at scale and made them commercially viable – computers, rockets, radar, Teflon, synthetic fibers, nuclear power, etc. Innovation clusters formed around universities like MIT and Harvard which had received large amounts of OSR&D funding (MIT’s Radiation Lab or “Rad Lab” employed 3,500 civilians during WWII and developed and built 100 radar systems deployed in theater,) or around professors who ran one of the OSR&D divisions – like Fred Terman at Stanford.Ironically, Vannevar Bush’s influence would decline even faster than Professor Lindemann’s. When President Roosevelt died in April 1945 and Secretary of War Stimson retired in September 1945, all the knives came out from the military leadership Bush had bypassed in the war. His arguments on how to reorganize OSR&D made more enemies in Congress. By 1948 Bush had retired from government service. He would never again play a role in the U.S. government.Britain’s focused, centralized model using government research labs was created in a struggle for short-term survival. They achieved brilliant breakthroughs but lacked the scale, integration and capital needed to dominate in the post-war world.The U.S. built a decentralized, collaborative ecosystem, one that tightly integrated massive government funding of universities for research and prototypes while private industry built the solutions in volume.A key component of this U.S. research ecosystem was the genius of the indirect cost reimbursement system. Not only did the U.S. fund researchers in universities by paying the cost of their salaries, the U.S. gave universities money for the researchers facilities and administration. This was the secret sauce that allowed U.S. universities to build world-class labs for cutting-edge research that were the envy of the world. Scientists flocked to the U.S. causing other countries to complain of a “brain drain.”Today, U.S. universities license 3,000 patents, 3,200 copyrights and 1,600 other licenses to technology startups and existing companies. Collectively, they spin out over 1,100 science-based startups each year, which lead to countless products and tens of thousands of new jobs. This university/government ecosystem became the blueprint for modern innovation ecosystems for other countries.By the end of the war, the U.S. and British innovation systems had produced radically different outcomes. Both systems were influenced by the experience and personalities of their nations science advisor.Britain remained a leader in theoretical science and defense technology, but its socialist government economic policies led to its failure to commercialize wartime innovations.The U.S. emerged as the global leader in science and technology, with innovations like electronics, microwaves, computing, and nuclear power driving its post-war economic boom.The university-industry-government partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley, the aerospace sector, and the biotechnology industry.Today, China’s leadership has spent the last three decades investing heavily to surpass the U.S. in science and technology.In 2025, with the abandonment of U.S. government support for university research, the long run of U.S. dominance in science may be over. Others will lead.

DESCRIPTION
OpenSAFELY represents a revolutionary approach to medical research that prioritizes patient privacy while enabling valuable insights from healthcare data. Rather than giving researchers direct access to sensitive GP records, it allows them to submit code that runs in a secure environment, with only privacy-checked aggregated results returned.

Hannes Lowette talks to Eli Holderness about how the system works, its benefits for ensuring reproducible science, the challenges of working with data not collected for research purposes, and its potential applications beyond healthcare. The approach balances the need for medical research with strict privacy protections, ensuring patients maintain trust in how their sensitive data is used.

The attackers reportedly exploited outdated PHP code and deprecated MySQL functions in 4chan's backend, particularly in a core script named yotsuba.php, which manages post submissions and moderation. A Soyjak.Party users also shared a list of emails they claimed are associated with janitor and moderator accounts, including three .edu emails. Although some internet users claimed that the leaks included .gov emails associated with members of the moderation team, this remains unverified.4chan was reportedly hacked by internet users claiming to be part of the Soyjak.Party community on April 14th, 2025. The hackers brought back the deleted /QA/ board, and temporarily granted access to 4chan's administrative site. An anonymous user posted about the hack on Soyjak.Party around 10:05 PM EST. The thread contained several bits of leaked information, a look into the /j/ board as well as the entirety of the "yotsuba.php" code, which handles features like posting and reporting. Another post in the thread claimed to be leaking the email addresses associated with various janitors, three of which were .edu emails.Early on April 15th, 2025, KiwiFarms user Coberald posted a copy of the leaked 4chan source code. A user named Tofflenheim also shared a link to an archive of posts on /j/, a private board dedicated to janitor discussions.X user @Priniz_twt was one of the first to post about the hack on April 14th, 2025, gathering over 5,000 likes in less than a day.On April 14th and April 15th, 2025, X user @_yushe posted screenshots from the 4chan administrative page as well as analyzed the leaked "yotsuba.php" code, which handles features like posting and reporting. The post gathered over 500 likes in less than a day.On April 15th, X user @_yushe noted that 4chan was likely hacked because it was using an outdated version of PHP (a coding language used to run the site), which is full of known vulnerabilities, and deprecated (no longer supported) functions to handle its database.Also on April 14th, X user @LumpyTheCook tweeted, "Apparently 4chan is down because someone hacked the lead admin (Hiro) account and started leaking all the mod and janitor emails, contact info, chat logs, etc. Good job Hiro 👍" The thread also included the unconfirmed claim that some janitors were using .gov emails, (although some leaked lists did contained .edu emails).On April 15th, 2025, Redditor /u/Meteorstar101 posted to the /r/greentext subreddit, writing, "Last posts before 4chan got hacked," and showing the Chicken Jockey meme.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Prometheus and Open-Source Observability with Eric Schabell</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/04/15/prometheus-and-open-source-observability-with-eric-schabell/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=prometheus-and-open-source-observability-with-eric-schabell</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED6279670658.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Unsure Calculator – back-of-a-napkin probabilistic calculator</title><link>https://filiph.github.io/unsure/</link><author>filiph</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 08:22:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/change-data-capture-cdc</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff728d711-09f5-40da-9d77-6969a8b45ace_2262x1552.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 05:43:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Dev - Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern applications often rely on multiple systems (e.g., search engines, caches, data lakes, microservices), all of which need . Traditional  are slow, introduce latency, and often lead to stale data and inconsistencies.Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern used to track and capture changes in a database (inserts, updates, deletes) and stream those changes in real time to downstream systems.This ensures downstream systems remain in sync without needing expensive batch jobs.In this article, we’ll dive into how CDC works, explore different implementation strategies, it’s real-world use cases, challenges and considerations.At a high level, CDC works by continuously monitoring a database for data changes (insertions, updates, and deletions). When a change occurs, CDC captures the change event and makes the information available for processing.The process typically involves: Detecting changes from source systems. This can be achieved through database triggers, reading transaction logs, or using specialized CDC tools. Extracting details about the change event (such as before and after values) along with metadata (e.g., timestamp, changed table). Transmitting the change event to consumers, which might include message queues, data pipelines, or real-time analytics systems.This helps in achieving event-driven architectures where applications respond to data changes as they happen.There are three main approaches to implementing CDC:This approach relies on adding a or column to your database tables. Every time a row is inserted or modified, this column is updated with the current timestamp. Applications then query the table for rows where the  time is later than the last sync time.SELECT * FROM orders WHERE last_updated > '2024-02-15 12:00:00'; Easy to implement without major changes to the database architecture.No External Dependencies: Can be executed with basic SQL operations, making it accessible for smaller projects or legacy systems. This method may not capture deleted records since the timestamp is typically updated on existing rows. As your data grows, frequent querying based on timestamps can impact performance, especially if indexing is not optimally configured. Misconfigured timestamp updates or clock skew issues can result in missed changes.Trigger-Based CDC involves setting up database triggers that automatically log changes to a separate audit table whenever an insert, update, or delete operation occurs. This audit table then serves as a reliable source of change records, which can be pushed to other systems as needed.CREATE TRIGGER order_changes 
AFTER UPDATE ON orders 
FOR EACH ROW 
INSERT INTO order_audit (order_id, old_status, new_status, changed_at) 
VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.status, NEW.status, NOW()); Triggers capture changes immediately when they occur. Offers a granular record of changes, including before-and-after values, which is useful for audit trails and debugging. Can be tailored to capture specific columns or changes. Triggers execute during the transaction, potentially slowing down database write operations.Complexity in Maintenance: Changes in database schema often require corresponding updates to trigger definitions. In high-transaction environments, the additional load of maintaining an audit table can become significant.Log-Based CDC reads changes directly from the database’s  or . This method intercepts the low-level database operations, enabling it to capture every change made to the database without interfering with the application’s normal workflow. An open-source platform that streams database changes. Often used in conjunction with Debezium to integrate with Apache Kafka. A managed service for data migration and CDC in the cloud. Minimizes the impact on the primary database since it leverages existing logs. Well-suited for large, high-transaction environments.Comprehensive Change Capture: Accurately captures every change, including inserts, updates, and deletes. Provides near real-time data movement, essential for dynamic data-driven systems. May require additional configuration and understanding of the underlying database logs.Dependency on Database Features: Not all databases expose their logs in a manner that is easy to consume. Often necessitates integration with additional tools or services, which can add to the overall system complexity.In modern applications, Log-based CDC is generally preferred because it efficiently captures all types of changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) directly from transaction logs, minimizes impact on the primary database, and scales well with high data volumes.3.1. Microservices CommunicationIn a microservices architecture, individual services often need to communicate and share state changes without being tightly coupled. With CDC in place, the change is captured and propagated via a messaging system (such as Kafka) so that each microservice can stay updated on the relevant changes in other services' databases without needing direct service-to-service calls.Event sourcing involves recording every change to an application state as a sequence of events. CDC can be leveraged to capture these changes in real time, building a complete log of all modifications.Consider a financial application that logs every transaction. Instead of simply updating an account’s balance, every deposit, withdrawal, or transfer is recorded as an event. CDC captures these events and builds a detailed log of all state changes. This audit trail can later be used to reconstruct any account’s history or to debug issues.Data warehousing involves consolidating large volumes of transactional data for analysis and reporting. CDC can capture database changes as they happen and push them into a data warehouse in near real-time.Analysts and decision-makers then use up-to-date data for reporting, analytics and dashboards.Caches are used to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data. However, stale cache data can cause issues, leading to outdated or incorrect information being displayed.CDC can trigger cache updates automatically whenever the underlying data changes.An online news platform uses caching to speed up page loads for popular articles. However, when an article is updated (e.g., a correction is issued or new content is added), the cache must be invalidated to prevent serving stale content. With CDC, changes in the content database are captured and automatically trigger cache updates, ensuring readers always see the most current information. is a popular open-source tool that provides log-based CDC for various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.When integrated with Apache Kafka, Debezium can capture and stream database changes in near real time.Step 1: Set Up Kafka and DebeziumBefore configuring Debezium, you need to have a running Kafka cluster.# Start Zookeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &

# Start Kafka Broker
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &Step 2: Configure Debezium Connector for MySQLNext, create a Debezium connector configuration to capture changes from your MySQL database. This configuration tells Debezium which database and tables to monitor, along with necessary connection details.{
  "name": "inventory-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "database.hostname": "localhost",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "cdc_user",
    "database.password": "password",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "database.include.list": "ecommerce",
    "table.include.list": "ecommerce.orders",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "dbhistory.inventory"
  }
}Step 3: Listen for ChangesOnce the Debezium connector is properly configured and running, it starts capturing change events from the MySQL database. These events are then published to Kafka topics. You can consume these events using Kafka command-line tools or any Kafka consumer application.bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic dbhistory.inventory --from-beginningWhile CDC is a powerful tool for real-time data integration, its implementation comes with several challenges that must be carefully managed:: Databases evolve over time, with changes such as adding or modifying columns. A robust CDC pipeline must gracefully adapt to schema alterations, ensuring that no data changes are lost or misinterpreted.: In high-transaction environments, large volumes of data changes can occur rapidly. It’s essential to design a CDC system that can process and relay these events efficiently to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.: Maintaining the correct sequence of events is critical, especially in distributed architectures. The CDC solution should ensure that events are processed in the exact order they occurred, preserving data integrity across all consuming services.: Because CDC involves capturing detailed data changes, it can expose sensitive information if not properly managed. Implementing robust security measures such as encryption, data masking, and strict access controls is vital to protect data and comply with regulatory requirements.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

A glimmer of hope for seriously ill people who have been waiting for years for a donor organ. Behind it all is a notorious network of international organ traffickers.

We have been following the trail for months. At the center is a transplant clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, where patients from Germany and Israel in particular meet donors from countries in the Caucasus such as Azerbaijan. There are also young Kenyans who are persuaded that they are getting a good deal at 4,000 euros for a kidney. Recipients pay up to €200,000 ($222,000 USD) to organ traffickers. There are many indications that local authorities are looking the other way and that politicians are covering up the trade.

Dualism is the theory that ultimate reality is composed of two radically different kinds of things, physical things and non-physical things, and that these same two kinds of things, expressed as body/brain and spirit/soul, account for consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Dualism (like the ‘interaction problem’)?

Today we're launching ActorCore (https://actorcore.org/), a stateful serverless framework that enables deploying Cloudflare Durable Object-like workloads to any cloud.If you're unfamiliar with stateful serverless: it's like the actor model, where each actor maintains its own isolated, persistent state. (Think Lambda functions with local storage & runs indefinitely.) It enables easily building long-running, realtime, durable, or local-first backends with the flexibility of serverless infrastructure. The most widely used implementation is Cloudflare Durable Objects, powering products like Clerk, Tldraw, Liveblocks, and Playroom.- Vendor lock-in: Developers are hesitant to adopt a new programming model if there's no clear off-ramp. While it's straightforward to migrate a Postgres database, stateful serverless platforms can feel locked-in due to lack of viable alternatives.- Ecosystem: Choosing a well-known database like Postgres comes with a mature ecosystem. Adopting a new model means rebuilding tooling and patterns from scratch.- Conceptual gap: Many developers have spent their entire careers designing systems with intentionally separated state and compute. A model that merges the two can feel backwards at first.We realized the best solution was to build a stateful serverless framework that can (a) be portable across clouds and (b) be easily extended – similar to how Hono created a unified API for traditional serverless functions across different providers. Thus, ActorCore was born.Today, ActorCore supports running stateful serverless on Rivet Actors, Cloudflare Durable Objects, Redis, and standalone Node.js/Bun. The most common use cases include applications using collaborative, AI agent, local-first, and per-tenant database features.State in ActorCore is an in-memory JavaScript object, with SQLite support coming later this month. State is stored in memory near your users on the edge, removing database round trips and minimizing latency due to physical distance. Additionally, state writes have tunable consistency, which enables both fully durable compute workloads and high-frequency state updates.You may have noticed that this still leaves concern #3: the conceptual gap. While this isn't something we can solve with a framework, I've been spending ~40% of my time working on docs, content, and examples to help resolve this. ActorCore is also turning out to be community-driven as hoped, which enables more people to try and share their experience with stateful serverless.We'd love it if you'd give ActorCore a try, read the roadmap, and/or let us know where we can improve anything. If you're hesitant about trying stateful serverless, I'd love to learn more in the comments. Looking forward to feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Tiny Brain Sensor Fits Between Strands of Hair</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/eeg-electrode</link><author>Greg Uyeno</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg4NjM2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjgxODk5N30.4Nwzkq6IH64BCuz4GDLxiFZctusFNRyV5Brqb3sQ-tM/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:39:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The small electrode, attached by microneedles, improves data quality]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why El Salvador President Bukele Is So Popular With Trump’s Inner Circle | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vZAPzdvOIg4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is one of the biggest right-wing icons in the world.

What exactly is the basis for democracy?

Arguably liberalism, the belief that the government serves the people, is the stone on which modern democracy was founded. That notion is so ingrained in the US that we often forget that America could be governed any other way.

But political philosopher John Gray believes that liberalism has been waning for a long, long time.

He joins Sean to discuss the great liberal thinker Thomas Hobbes and America's decades-long transition away from liberalism.

It's a very important feature and it's one of the very few remaining things which wasn't supported by Linux Mint Debian Edition." 

Slashdot reader BrianFagioli speculates that "this could be a sign of something much bigger."
OEM installs are typically reserved for operating systems meant to ship on hardware. It's how companies preload Linux on laptops without setting a username, password, or timezone... Mint has supported this for years — but only in its Ubuntu-based version. So why is this feature suddenly coming to Linux Mint Debian Edition, which the team has repeatedly described as a contingency? In other words, if the Debian variant is merely a plan B, why make it ready for OEMs? 

Their blog post goes on to speculate about possible explanations (like the hypothetical possibility of dissatisfaction with Snap packages or Canonical's decisions around telemetry and packaging). 

Slashdot reached out to Linux Mint project leader Clement Lefebvre, who responded cheerfully that "I know people love to speculate on this. There's no hidden agenda on our side though. 

"Improving LMDE is a continuous effort. It's something we do regularly."

"Any LMDE improvement facilitates a future potential transition to Debian, of course. But there are other reasons to implement OEM support. 

"We depend on Ubiquity in Linux Mint. We have a much simpler installer, with no dependencies, no technical debt and with a design we're in control of in LMDE. Porting LMDE's live-installer to Linux Mint is something we're looking into. Implementing OEM support in live-installer kills two birds with one stone. It improves LMDE and opens the door to switching away from Ubiquity in Linux Mint."

Vivien worked as an escort and dominatrix for four years. Christina was forced into sex work by her drug-addicted mother.

The change in the law regarding sex work presupposes that people offer sexual services voluntarily and that they are of legal age. However, the reality is often different.

Vivien and Christina talk about their lives as sex workers and how they got out. Vivien is now a social worker, supporting young girls. She was raised in a single-parent household and money was extremely tight. She also longed for male recognition. She was often sexually exploited and was even raped once. She ceased sex work in 2022 and is now involved with Sisters e. V., an organization that supports sex workers. 

A shelter for women was Christina's salvation. She was forced to offer her body in brothels, brothels, and, often, on the streets. In the process, she experienced a lot of violence. Christina was able to escape in a cloak-and-dagger operation. But she had trouble adjusting, and her inner demons rose up inside her. She went back into the milieu - into a life she knew. After a year, she left for a second time - this time successfully. Today she lives with her young daughter in a shelter.

Since the new sex work law passed, there have been fewer investigations into human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. But many women are afraid to testify, says Helmut Sporer, a former senior criminal investigator in the field of sex work and human trafficking.

To claim God is the Creator is to assume the burden of explaining why God selected and created this particular world. What are the characteristics of this world that could credential it as the one that the Supreme Being brought into existence? Theists do not like to argue that our world is the ‘best possible world’.

And if you already knew that, there’s a good chance it’s because you’ve watched N-B-C’s long running police-procedural-slash-legal-drama, Law and Order, or one of its roughly six hundred spin-offs.  Famous for its split perspective between two sets of protagonists, Law and Order not only became one of the biggest shows of the 90s, but also one of the biggest franchises in the history of television.

ORIGINAL TALK TITLE
From Gamepads to Launchpads: What the Tech World Can Learn from Video Game UX

ABSTRACT
Ever wondered why video games are so good at keeping players engaged, informed, and empowered? It’s not magic—it’s deep mastery of user experience.

In this talk, I’ll reveal how the same principles that game developers use to guide players through complex game worlds can be applied to other fields. In this talk, Theo will use game design examples from her work on games for NASA and Space X's Polaris Dawn and Artemis missions to illustrate how game developers weave these experiences with concrete techniques and principles. By applying these techniques, other tech fields can elevate their user interactions to be just as intuitive, engaging, and effective.

Get ready for a journey from gamepads to launchpads that might just change how you see UX and your relationship with your users. [...]

Is It More Famous Than Linux?</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/04/13/0110228/torvalds-celebrates-gits-20th-anniversary-is-it-more-famous-than-linux?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 03:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Celebrating Git's 20th anniversary, GitHub hosted a Q&A with Linus Torvalds, writes Its FOSS News. 

Among the other revelations: He says his college-age daughter sent a texting saying he's better known at her CS lab for Git than for Linux, "because they actually use Git for everything there." Which he describes as "ridiculous" because he maintained it for just four months before handing it off to Junio Hamano who's been heading up development for more than 19 years now. "When it did what I needed," Torvalds says, "I lost interest."


 Linus then goes on to share how Git was never a big thing for him, but a means to an end that prevented the Linux kernel from descending into chaos over the absence of a version control system. You see, before Git, Linux used BitKeeper for version control, but its proprietary licensing didn't sit too well with other Linux contributors, and Linus Torvalds had to look for alternatives. As it turned out, existing tools like CVS and Subversion were too slow for the job at hand, prompting him to build a new tool from scratch, with the coding part just taking 10 days for an early self-hostable version of Git. 
In its initial days, there were some teething issues, where users would complain about Git to Linus, even finding it too difficult to use, but things got calmer as the tool developed further. 

Torvalds thinks some early adopters had trouble because they were coming from a background that was more like CVS. "The Git mindset, I came at it from a file system person's standpoint, where I had this disdain and almost hatred of most source control management projects, so I was not at all interested in maintaining the status quo."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Did Europe Rebuild After The Second World War?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG4KOzwbjX4</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dG4KOzwbjX4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 21:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the tumultuous years immediately following World War 2 in Europe.

Many legends surround the most famous buccaneers. But who were these men? Simple sailors or brutal thieves? How did they live? This film journeys back in time for answers.

The period between 1690 and 1730 is considered the golden age of piracy. Pirates continue to occupy a special place in the legends of sea adventure: As romantic figures and heroes of stories, pirates still enjoy a positive image today. 

But does this image -- shaped by Hollywood and fiction -- correspond to reality? So far, only a few wrecks of pirate ships have been located and little is known about the everyday lives of the crews. On Mauritius, and in the bay of the Sainte Marie Island off Madagascar, two research missions are seeking concrete answers to these questions. 

Archaeologists are exploring the remains of the "Speaker”, the ship that belonged to the famous pirate John Bowen, who died 1704. The scientists are also researching traces of his crew's stays ashore. Until now, the history of piracy was thought to be largely localized in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean; only a few historians suspected the existence of pirates off the coasts of Madagascar. 

Over the course of his research in the National Library of France, archaeologist Jean Soulat from the LandArc laboratory in Paris discovered documents that led his ideas in new directions -- and turned his previous ideas about piracy on their heads. He decided to put together an international research team of archaeologists and historians to conduct further study. For the first time, numerous aspects of pirates‘ daily lives - on land, and on the water -- are being recreated.

Do they have feelings? Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary O’Reilly, and Harrison Greenbaum explore the intelligence of plants with astrobotanist Simon Gilroy. From venus flytraps to space farming, we dig deep into the secret world of plants.

We start by looking at plant awareness—do plants know they’re being eaten? Can they predict where the sun is going to be in the morning? How do plants communicate internally without a central nervous system or a brain? Simon explains how plants communicate through chemistry, using glutamate signals, and how psychoactive molecules help defend the plant from predators. 

We explore one of nature’s weirdest plants: the Venus flytrap. Can it count? How does it actually move? And can plants form memories? We explore how plants “learn” from past experiences as well as the dark side to the smell of freshly mowed grass. If a plant survives a harsh winter, how does it know when it’s safe to grow again? Plus, we ask: do plants know when they're in space? 

How do plants react in microgravity? Can they tell which way is up without gravity to guide them? What happens when you try to grow plants in lunar soil—can they survive without the nutrients they depend on here on Earth? And if Martian soil is toxic, could astronauts really fertilize their crops using composted waste? How close are we to turning science fiction into reality?
Finally, could we engineer tastier space food? Would tomatoes grown in orbit taste the same as those on Earth? What about spicy peppers—does space change their flavor? We discuss what foods should be targeted for space farming and what farming on another planet would look like. What if the light around another star is in a different spectrum? Join us as we explore the fascinating frontier of astrobotany and the hidden intelligence of the plants around us!

Over 40 million people in the western United States and northern Mexico depend on the Colorado River’s water. But the water supply has been pushed to its limit and most of it flows into agriculture. In addition, to this day, water from the river is distributed in accordance with an agreement that dates back over a century and experts have said that more water was promised then than the system could sustainably give – a problem that has been made worse by climate change. It’s a perfect storm: Outdated laws, urban growth, climate change and agriculture are causing the river to dry up. So, by the time the Colorado River reaches Mexico, which has a share of 10%, there’s not much water left.

ABSTRACT
In this code-driven talk using Kotlin, Spring Boot and htmx, Rod will show just how good the JVM is as a platform for building GenAI applications.

He'll show how to use Spring AI to build a chatbot with personality, covering:
• RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using a VectorStore
• Why and how to mix different LLMs, including open source LLMs running locally, in the same application
• How the Spring AI "advisor" architecture can be used to create clean, reusable components
• How to add a toxicity guard and other crosscutting functionality
• How and why to exchange structured data with LLMs
• Best practices for building GenAI applications

He'll share his code on GitHub so attendees can continue their own exploration. [...]

According to the change proposal announced March 31, Fedora has already reached 90% reproducibility through infrastructure changes including "clamping" file modification times and implementing a Rust-based "add-determinism" tool that standardizes metadata. The remaining 10% will require individual package maintainer involvement, treating reproducibility failures as bugs. 

The effort will use a public instance of rebuilderd to independently verify that binary packages can be reproduced from source code. Unlike Debian's bit-by-bit reproducibility definition, Fedora allows differences in package signatures and some metadata while requiring identical payloads. The initiative follows similar efforts by Debian and openSUSE, and comes amid heightened focus on supply-chain security after the recent XZ backdoor incident.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hour by Hour: Inside The Titanic’s Engine Room As It Sank</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0mUH4fH09E</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i0mUH4fH09E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 21:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The story of the engineers who worked tirelessly to keep the electric power running as the Titanic sank.

Privacy advocates warned that Recall was ripe for abuse in intimate partner violence settings. They also noted that there was nothing stopping Recall from preserving sensitive disappearing content sent through privacy-protecting messengers such as Signal.Enshittification at a new scaleFollowing months of backlash, Microsoft later suspended Recall. On Thursday, the company said it was reintroducing Recall. It currently is available only to insiders with access to the Windows 11 Build 26100.3902 preview version.

This discussion explores how Lyft uses time series forecasting to respond to real-time market dynamics, covering practical tips and tricks for implementing these methods, an in-depth look at their adaptability for online re-training, and discussions on their interpretability and user intervention capabilities. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how time series forecasting can outperform DNNs, and how to effectively use time series forecasting for dynamic market conditions and decision-making applications.// BioJosh is a data scientist from the Marketplace team at Lyft, working on forecasting and modeling of marketplace signals that power products like pricing and driver incentives. Josh got his PHD in Operations Research in 2013, with minors in Statistics and Economics.

ABSTRACT
Programming languages are a halfway house between the metal and the mind, a bridge between the world of circuits and the world of applications, the engineered and the social. Programming languages are the medium through which developers codify systems and fragments.
In each programming language is embedded a philosophy (or many) of how to think about code, how to organise thoughts, how to design. Programming languages also define skillsets, ecosystems, jobs, loyalties and communities.

When we think of software and technology we often think in terms of progress and rapid change. Programming languages, however, typically move at a far slower pace. Mainstream languages are still embracing ideas that are decades old. Constructs that developers welcome as new to their language of choice are often older than the developers themselves. And over all this hangs the question, what of the future?
How will current trends, from FOSS to LLMs, shape programming languages and their use?

In this talk, we will take a tour of the past, present and future of programming languages. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Barbara Oakley, renowned author and polymath joins Charles Humble for a deep dive into the brain's modes of operation, exploring the focused and diffuse modes of thinking, which together enhance learning by balancing task-oriented problem-solving with creativity.

They emphasize the importance of mental relaxation and the role of exercise, sleep, and a healthy diet in boosting cognitive function. Key concepts such as deliberate practice, retrieval practice, and the value of psychological safety in team dynamics are explored, offering insights into effective learning and collaboration. The relationship between working memory and long-term memory is examined, highlighting how techniques like the Pomodoro Technique and spaced repetition optimize retention. Additionally, the conversation underscores the potential of AI in education, encouraging its integration despite concerns among educators.

Lastly, the phenomenon of rustiness in skill retention is explained through the dynamics of neural connections, with a hopeful outlook on the future of neuroscience research in understanding conditions like autism and dyslexia.

The results are a sobering reminder that, despite bold pronouncements from companies like OpenAI, AI is still no match for human experts in domains such as coding. 

The study's co-authors tested nine different models as the backbone for a "single prompt-based agent" that had access to a number of debugging tools, including a Python debugger. They tasked this agent with solving a curated set of 300 software debugging tasks from SWE-bench Lite. 

According to the co-authors, even when equipped with stronger and more recent models, their agent rarely completed more than half of the debugging tasks successfully. Claude 3.7 Sonnet had the highest average success rate (48.4%), followed by OpenAI's o1 (30.2%), and o3-mini (22.1%).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saturn&apos;s Giant Scarred World They Didn&apos;t Teach You About in School | Our Solar System&apos;s Moons: Dione</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lJB8ynBibI</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4lJB8ynBibI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Venture 1.2 billion kilometers out across the solar system to explore Dione, Saturn's fractured ice world.

From the summer of 1944, Hitler's armies had suffered a series of cataclysmic defeats that had left them shattered and desperately trying to hold on in front of the capital of the Third Reich. But how the Soviets' been able to bring the once mighty German Army to the brink of total defeat, and did the Wehrmacht have one last throw of the dice to save the Nazi regime?In this episode, Dan is joined by Professor Evan Mawdsley, author of Thunder in the East: The Nazi-Soviet War 1941-1945 and former Professor of International History at the University of Glasgow. Evan helps Dan explore the stark differences in the narrative of World War II's final months across Western and Eastern Europe. They also discuss the key events from Operation Bagration in June 1944 to the Soviets' advance on Berlin in 1945 and how these tie in with the advance of the Western Allies. Also, could Stalin's strategic decisions have brought the war to an end sooner, and what did Hitler's last offensive in Hungary reveal about the dictator's priorities?Produced and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers concerned to find AI models misrepresenting their “reasoning” processes</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/robot_fibbing-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 22:37:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Remember when teachers demanded that you "show your work" in school?

This documentary dissects the chilling speed of the Nazi ascent: fueled by economic desperation, masterminded propaganda, and brutal suppression. Witness Hitler's early triumphs, the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the annexation of Austria, the conquest of Europe, and the hubris that led to his catastrophic downfall. From the horrors of the Holocaust to the brutal reality of Blitzkrieg, this is the story of a regime built on delusion and violence, a regime that plunged the world into war and ultimately consumed itself in the flames of its own making.

Call the Midwife
In Season 14, the midwives enter the 1970s, which brings with it new challenges for Nonnatus House – and to British society. The Seventies start as they mean to go on, with Nonnatus House plunged into disarray when activists staging a bid for independence blockade access to the Isle of Dogs. Amid the poverty and uncertainty of life in a declining Docklands, the midwives must also face cases of manic depression, gonorrhea, spina bifida, abortion – and an apparently immaculate conception.

--

After wreaking havoc across the heavens and being captured in a white-hot prison cell, the Monkey King freed himself once more and was itching for a fight. Desperate, the Jade Emperor called on the supreme power in all the heavens: the Buddha himself. But even in the face of this almighty opponent, Sun Wukong was not cowed. Ji Hao follows the Monkey King's quest to outwit the Buddha.

DESCRIPTION
In this GOTO Book Club interview, Jacqui Read discusses with Barry O'Reilly his books "Residues: Time, Uncertainty, and Change in Software Architecture" and "The Architect's Paradox". He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality—a method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting "residues" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.

Unlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.

O'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.

Clients can retrieve or update values by providing the corresponding key, similar to how a  works.A distributed key-value store takes this concept a step further. Instead of storing all the data on a single machine, it spreads the data across multiple servers (or nodes).This distribution enables the system to , handling large volumes of data and user requests, while maintaining  and .But this also introduces a new set of challenges like:How do we efficiently store and retrieve data?How do we persist data to prevent loss during node crashes?How do we evenly distribute data across multiple nodes?How do we keep the data consistent across nodes?How do we detect and recover from node failures?In this article, we’ll walk through how to design a distributed key-value store from the ground up, one that is capable of handling large-scale workloads with , , and .We’ll begin by identifying the  (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should behave).Then, we’ll start with a  and progressively evolve it into a fully distributed system, one building block at a time. Along the way, we’ll explore key system design concepts such as:Consistency models (strong, eventual, causal)By the end of this post, you’ll have a solid understanding of what it takes to build a production-grade distributed key-value store and the trade-offs involved at each stage of the design.1. Functional RequirementsAt its core, our key-value store must support basic  operations focused on keys: – Insert a new key-value pair or update the value if the key already exists. This is the primary write operation. – Retrieve the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn’t exist, return an appropriate result (e.g. null or error). – Remove the key and its associated value from the store. After deletion, a subsequent GET on that key should indicate that it no longer exists.2. Non-Functional RequirementsTo be usable at scale, our distributed store must meet several critical non-functional goals:The system should scale horizontally to handle massive amounts of data and traffic as demand grows.The store must remain accessible with minimal downtime, even in the face of server failures. There should be no single point of failure.Operations like GET and PUT should return results quickly—ideally within a few milliseconds.The system should support a large number of operations per second and serve many concurrent clients without significant performance degradation.1. Start Simple – A Single Node Key-Value StoreBefore jumping into a fully distributed setup, it’s important to understand the basics. Let’s start with the simplest version of a key-value store: one that runs on a .At this stage, the entire system consists of just one server responsible for handling all client requests.The design is straightforward:The server stores data in memory, using a hash map or dictionary-like structure.It exposes basic operations: – Add a new entry or update an existing one – Retrieve the value for a key – Remove a key and its valueHere’s a basic Java-like pseudocode for the core logic:Map<String, String> store = new HashMap<>();

void put(String key, String value) {
    store.put(key, value);
}

String get(String key) {
    return store.getOrDefault(key, null);
}

void delete(String key) {
    store.remove(key);
}Clients send HTTP requests (or use some lightweight protocol), and the server responds accordingly. PUT /set?key=user1&value=JohnThis setup works perfectly for simple use cases, small-scale prototypes, or local development environments but this architecture breaks down quickly in real-world scenarios:If the server crashes, the data is lost, and the system becomes unavailable.You're constrained by the memory, CPU, and storage of a single machine.The system can’t handle growing traffic or data volume. There’s no way to scale out by adding more machines.One bug, hardware issue, or network failure can bring the entire system down.2. Add Persistence – Don’t Lose Data on RestartOur single-node key-value store works, but only until the server crashes or restarts. Once that happens, everything in memory is wiped out. All the data is gone.To make our store useful in the real world, we need , a way to ensure data survives restarts, crashes, or power failures.Let’s walk through how we can add persistence without complicating the system too much.The most common and reliable approach is to use a . Before making any change to the in-memory data, we append the operation to a file on disk.Every time a  or  is issued, it’s logged to disk before applying it to the in-memory store.If the server crashes, we can  during startup to rebuild the state.It ensures durability without relying entirely on memory.Snapshotting – Speeding Up RecoveryOver time, the log file grows. Replaying thousands (or millions) of operations on startup can be slow.To fix this, we periodically create , a full dump of the current in-memory key-value store to disk.Load the latest snapshot.Replay only the log entries after the snapshot.This reduces startup time while keeping the system durable.By adding persistence, we’ve made our system:: Data won’t vanish after a restart.: We can rebuild state even after a crash.: Still basic, but safer.At this point, we’ve built a durable single-node key-value store. It can survive crashes and restarts. But there’s one major problem we haven’t solved yet:The amount of data exceeds the capacity of a single machine?Traffic spikes and one server can’t keep up?We want to support millions of users?A single server also creates a —any bug, hardware failure, or crash can bring the entire system down.To overcome these limitations, we’ll move toward  by partitioning the data across multiple nodes.3.

The same thing that makes them useful for benign tasks—the breadth of data available to them and their ability to use it to generate content at scale—can often be used in malicious activities just as easily. OpenAI revoked the spammers’ account in February.“You are a helpful assistant”The spam blast is the work of AkiraBot—a framework that automates the sending of messages in large quantities to promote shady search optimization services to small- and medium-size websites. AkiraBot used python-based scripts to rotate the domain names advertised in the messages. It also used OpenAI’s chat API tied to the model gpt-4o-mini to generate unique messages customized to each site it spammed, a technique that likely helped it bypass filters that look for and block identical content sent to large numbers of sites. The messages are delivered through contact forms and live chat widgets embedded into the targeted websites.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After months of user complaints, Anthropic debuts new $200/month AI plan</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/anthropic-launches-200-claude-max-ai-plan-with-20x-higher-usage-limits/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/anthropic_max-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 19:20:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Anthropic introduced a new $100- to $200-per-month subscription tier called Claude Max that offers expanded usage limits for its Claude AI assistant. The new plan arrives after many existing Claude subscribers complained of hitting rate limits frequently."The top request from our most active users has been expanded Claude access," wrote Anthropic in a news release. A brief stroll through user feedback on Reddit seems to confirm that sentiment, showing that many Claude users have been unhappy with Anthropic's usage limits over the past year—even on the Claude Pro plan, which costs $20 a month.One of the downsides of a relatively large context window with Claude (the amount of text it can process at once) has been that long conversations or inclusions of many reference documents (such as code files) fill up usage limits quickly. That's because each time the user adds to the conversation, the entire text of the conversation (including any attached documents) is fed back into the AI model again and re-evaluated. But on the other hand, a large context window allows Claude to process more complex projects within each session.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2302 - Ron White</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNxzn-vRodY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nNxzn-vRodY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ron White is a stand-up comic, actor, and author.

Most have a default configuration and many allow the user to adjust that configuration. There are many different types of configuration files. Some use text files while others use databases. Python has a standard library called  that you can use to work with Microsoft Windows INI files.In this tutorial, you will cover the following topics:By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use INI configuration files programmatically with Python.There are many examples of INI files on the Internet. You can find one over in the Mypy documentation. Mypy is a popular type checker for Python. Here is the  file that they use as an example:# Global options:

[mypy]
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True

# per-module options:

[mypy-mycode.foo.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True

[ypy-mycode.bar]
warn_return_any = False

[mypy-somelibrary]
ignore_missing_imports = TrueSections are denoted by being placed inside square braces. Then, each section can have zero or more settings. In the next section, you will learn how to create this configuration file programmatically with Python.The documentation for Python’s module is helpful. They tell you how to recreate an example INI file right in the documentation. Of course, their example is not the Mypy example above. Your job is a little bit harder as you need to be able to insert comments into your configuration, which isn’t covered in the documentation. Don’t worry. You’ll learn how to do that now!Open up your Python editor and create a new file called . Then enter the following code:# create_config.py

import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)

config["mypy"] = {"warn_return_any": "True",
                  "warn_unused_configs": "True",}
config.set("mypy", "\n# Per-module options:")

config["mypy-mycode.foo.*"] = {"disallow_untyped_defs": "True"}
config["ypy-mycode.bar"] = {"warn_return_any": "False"}
config["mypy-somelibrary"] = {"ignore_missing_imports": "True"}

with open("custom_mypy.ini", "w") as config_file:
    config_file.write("# Global options:\n\n")
    config.write(config_file)

The documentation states that  parameter allows for including sections that do not have values. You need to add this to be able to add comments in the middle of a section to be added as well. Otherwise, you will get a .To add entire sections, you use a dictionary-like interface. Each section is denoted by the key, and that section’s values are added by setting that key to another dictionary.Once you finish creating each section and its contents, you can write the configuration file to disk. You open a file for writing, then write the first comment. Next, you use the  method to write the rest of the file.Try running the code above; you should get the same INI file as the one at the beginning of this article.The library makes editing your configuration files mostly painless. You will learn how to change a setting in the config file and add a new section to your pre-existing configuration.Create a new file named  and add the following code to it:# edit_config.py

import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read("custom_mypy.ini")

# Change an item's value
config.set("mypy-somelibrary", "ignore_missing_imports", "False")

# Add a new section
config["new-random-section"] = {"compressed": "True"}

with open("modified_mypy.ini", "w") as config_file:
    config.write(config_file)
In this case, after create the instance, you call to read the specified configuration file. Then you can set any value you want.Unfortunately, you cannot use dictionary-like syntax to set values. Instead, you must use which takes the following parameters: – The name of the section. – The option you wish to change. – The new value you want to set.Adding a new section works like it did when you created the initial sections in the last code example. You still use dictionary-like syntax where the new section is the key and the value is a dictionary of one or more settings to go in your section.When you run this code, it will create an INI file with the following contents:[mypy]
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True

[mypy-mycode.foo.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True

[ypy-mycode.bar]
warn_return_any = False

[mypy-somelibrary]
ignore_missing_imports = False

[new-random-section]
compressed = True

Good job! You’ve just learned how to modify an INI file with Python!Now you are ready to learn about reading INI files.You already caught a glimpse of how to read a configuration file in the previous section. The primary method is by calling the ‘s method.Here’s an example using the new INI file you just created:>>> import configparser
>>> config = configparser.ConfigParser()
>>> config.read(r"C:\code\modified_mypy.ini")
['C:\\code\\modified_mypy.ini']
>>> config["mypy"]
<Section: mypy>
>>> config["mypy"]["warn_return_any"]
'True'
>>> config["unknown"]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  Python Shell, prompt 8, line 1
    config["unknown"]
  File "c:\users\Mike\appdata\local\programs\python\python312\lib\configparser.py", line 941, in __getitem__
    raise KeyError(key)
builtins.KeyError: 'unknown'You can access individual values using dictionary syntax. If you happen to try to access a section or an option that does not exist, you will receive a .The  has a second reading method called  that you can use as well. Here is an example:>>> sample_config = """
... [mypy]
... warn_return_any = True
... warn_unused_configs = True
... 
... # Per-module options:
... 
... [mypy-mycode.foo.*]
... disallow_untyped_defs = True
... """
>>> config = configparser.ConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)
>>> config.read_string(sample_config)
>>> config["mypy"]["warn_return_any"]
'True'You use  to read in a multiline string and then access values inside of it. Pretty neat, eh?You can also grab the section and them use list comprehensions to extract the options from each section:>>> config.sections()
['mypy', 'mypy-mycode.foo.*']
>>> [option for option in config["mypy"]]
['warn_return_any', 'warn_unused_configs']The code above is a handy example for getting at the configuration options quickly and easily.Having a way to configure your application makes it more useful and allows the user more control over how their copy of the application works. In this article, you learned how about the following topics:The configparser library has more features than what is covered here. For example, you can use interpolation to preprocess values or customize the parser process. Check out the documentation for full details on those and other features.In the meantime, have fun and enjoy this neat feature of Python!You might also be interested in these related articles:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficient Reliable Database Migration: A Legacy Innovation Story • Dave Thomas • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejmi16BFnE</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aejmi16BFnE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

ABSTRACT
Data migrations often fail due to underestimated complexity. This talk explores a critical, large-scale migration at a major ERP company that demanded high performance, reliability, and aggressive timelines.

We'll describe novel techniques including efficient bulk data transfer, table-driven approaches, functional prototyping, and a unique application of IV&V for robust testing. Learn how algorithms developed in distributed systems research solved real-world problems in legacy system modernization.

Discover strategies to implement reliable migration techniques and meet tight deadlines. This talk offers valuable insights for data engineers, architects, and development leaders facing migrations of any scale. [...]

However, Microsoft is up front about the limitations: "We do not intend for this to fully replicate the actual experience of playing the original  game," the researchers wrote on the project's announcement page.Carmack's comments came after an X user with the handle "Quake Dad" called the new demo "disgusting" and claimed it "spits on the work of every developer everywhere." The critic expressed concern that such technology would eliminate jobs in an industry already facing layoffs, writing: "A fully generative game cuts out the number of jobs necessary for such a project which in turn makes it harder for devs to get jobs."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can you solve this SAT question?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC98ZK6Ivug</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZC98ZK6Ivug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 16:59:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How an SAT question became a mathematical paradox.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Last Greyhound Racetrack in America</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3FlVNN0-AI</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/u3FlVNN0-AI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 16:52:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've got a gambling issue or any debt, PDS Debt is offering a free debt analysis.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Harrison Greenbaum explore black hole collisions, quantum tricks, and how gravitational waves can help us uncover the early universe with MIT physicist and LIGO researcher Nergis Mavalvala.

What are gravitational waves, and how do they stretch and squeeze spacetime? We break down Hawking radiation and why gravity itself doesn’t get sucked into a black hole. How did Einstein predict them, and why did it take a century to confirm their existence? Nergis breaks down how LIGO can measure distortions smaller than a proton. How do scientists bypass and manipulate quantum uncertainty to measure gravitational waves? 

We go over Einstein’s general relativity and what cosmic phenomena it predicted. We dive into the violent collisions of black holes—what happens when objects moving at half the speed of light crash together? Learn how LIGO works and how lasers help us to make these minuscule measurements. Could gravitational waves let us see into the universe’s earliest moments before the cosmic microwave background? 

Finally, how does every great scientific discovery build on those that came before? What technological advancements might come from gravitational wave research? And most importantly—why does this all matter for our understanding of the universe?

--

In the 17th century, Isaac Newton offered the first gravitational explanation of tides. As he correctly identified, tides are choreographed by the motions of celestial objects, and Earth’s tides in particular are mostly driven by the Moon. But the precise nature of this relationship is actually quite nuanced. Elise Cutts explains how the Sun and Moon are responsible for the tides.

The U.S. has one military base on the island called the Pituffik Space Base and began stationing forces here after Denmark was invaded by Germany during WWII. So why did the U.S. exit the territory in the first place and what level of involvement do they have on the island today?

WSJ explains Denmark’s efforts to boost defense here with dog-sleds and drones – and why the U.S. abandoned several military bases there decades ago.

Abstract:
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has primarily been dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which can handle complex tasks and generate detailed responses. However, these models require significant resources, making them difficult to use in resource-constrained educational settings. This proposal explores how Small Language Models (SLMs) — simpler, open-source and more affordable AI systems — can transform education by offering personalized learning and scalable solutions, even in low-resource environments.

Introduction:
SLMs are smaller, simpler versions of AI models that are easier to use and cost less. Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which need powerful computers, SLMs can work on basic devices, making them ideal for schools with limited budgets. They maintain efficiency and accessibility while offering targeted solutions tailored to specific educational needs. By focusing on domain-specific knowledge, local languages, and contextual customization, SLMs address the equity and inclusivity gaps often exacerbated by larger models.

Methodology:
This approach leverages insights from recent implementations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in education. Key methodologies include:
1. Fine-tuning on Localized Data: Customizing SLMs to address specific learner needs and proficiency levels.
2. Using Lightweight AI Frameworks: Deploying open-source, resource-efficient tools for underserved communities and low-resource settings.
3. Integrating SLMs into Systems: Adding SLMs to existing learning platforms to create personalized plans and adjust lessons based on students' progress.
4. Real-World Success Stories: Demonstrating how SLMs enhance teaching through automation, support student progress, and operate efficiently without high-end infrastructure.

Demo Proposal:
We will showcase a live demonstration to highlight how Small Language Models (SLMs) can be effectively deployed in real-world educational settings. The demonstration will feature:
Personalized Learning Assistant:
A fine-tuned open-source Small Language Model(SLM) will be used to create personalized learning plans tailored to students' progress and feedback. The key benefits include:
1. Adaptability to Individual Needs: The system adjusts the complexity of learning materials based on each student’s progress. For slow learners, subjects are presented gradually, with difficulty levels, without overwhelming them. This step-by-step progression builds confidence, enhances engagement, and promotes a deeper understanding of concepts, contributing to their long-term success and mental well-being.
2. Affordability in Resource-Constrained Settings: SLMs are optimized for low-resource hardware, making them a cost-effective solution for schools and communities with limited budgets.
This demo will illustrate how SLMs can empower educators and improve learning outcomes, making quality education accessible to all.

Strengths of SLMs:
Small Language Models offer several key advantages for education:
1. Low Resource Requirements: They run on basic devices like low-cost laptops or mobile phones.
2. Cost-Effective: Affordable for schools with limited budgets or in developing regions.
3. Ease of Updates: Easy to adapt to new curricula or local content.
4. Privacy-Friendly: On-device processing ensures student data security.
5. Personalization: Tailors learning to individual student needs and paces.
6. Support for Local Languages: Adaptable to regional languages and cultural contexts.
7. Energy Efficient: Uses less energy, supporting sustainable AI use.
8. Scalable: Easy to implement across schools and districts.

Limitations of SLMs:
1. Less Powerful: SLMs may struggle with complex tasks like handling multi-disciplinary contexts or generating nuanced responses.
2. Performance Risks: Aggressively scaling down models can lead to degraded accuracy, especially for tasks requiring deep understanding.
3. Requires Careful Design: Achieving balance between simplicity and performance demands thoughtful optimization and regular evaluation.

LLMs have been very useful and we have high potential for LLMs in Enterprises. However, evaluating these models remains a complex challenge and one of the reasons for LLMs not being adopted directly. 
The responsible and ethical AI is going to be the key for Enterprises to adopt the LLMs for their business needs.
Traditional metrics like perplexity or BLEU score often fail to capture the nuanced capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. 
This talk is about current best practices in benchmarking LLMs, limitations of existing approaches and emerging evaluation techniques.

We’ll explore a range of qualitative and quantitative metrics, 
from task-specific benchmarks (e.g., code generation, summarization) 
to user-centric evaluations (e.g., coherence, creativity, bias detection). 
importance of specialized benchmarks that test LLMs on ethical and explainability grounds

Outcome : The audience will be able to understand how to choose LLMs for the right balance of accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. Additionally understand what has improved in granite 3.0 which makes it better LLM.

With the advent of containers, Kubernetes became the de-facto tool to manage these millions of containers. While IP address is a scarce resource, every last pod in Kubernetes demand its own IP address. From infrastructure design perspective, it presents a challenge. A key aspect of container networking is IP address management, which often gets overlooked. How Kubernetes assigns IP address to pods is determined by the IPAM (IP Address Management) plugin being used. Different IPAM plugins provide different feature sets. This talk throws some light on how some of the open source CNI plugins tackles the challenge of IP exhaustion and approaches IPAM.

A gentle introduction to functional programming with dependent types.
Dependent types enhance precision and safety of programs, allowing programmers to design software with higher assurance guarantees.
Various interesting examples will be presented to illustrate the use of Dependent Type Theory, using the Lean4 programming language and theorem prover.
Lean4 has some nice features like interactive evaluation, compilation to native code, and while so far mostly being used to formalize mathematics it is also a formidable modern elegant programming language.

But to truly harness its potential, understanding its internal architecture and advanced features is essential.In this blog post, we’ll take a deep dive into PostgreSQL’s core components and capabilities, with insights that will help you optimize performance, scalability, and reliability in your applications.Process-Based Architecture: How PostgreSQL manages connections for stability and isolation.Write Ahead Logging (WAL): Ensuring data durability, crash recovery, and replication.Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Allowing concurrent reads and writes without blocking.: From parsing and planning to execution and result delivery.: Choosing the right index for your data.: Managing large tables efficiently with range, list, or hash-based partitioning.: Streaming changes for replication and change data capture.: Extending PostgreSQL’s capabilities with custom features.: Real-time insights for monitoring and optimizing database performance.1. Process-Based ArchitecturePostgreSQL follows a process-per-connection architecture, meaning each client connection is handled by a dedicated operating system process.When the PostgreSQL server (postmaster) starts, it listens for incoming connections on the configured port. For each new client connection, it forks a new backend process to handle that session​. This backend process handles all communication and query execution for that client.Once the session ends (i.e., the client disconnects), the associated process terminates.This architecture differs from  used in some other databases (e.g., MySQL or SQL Server), where a single process spawns threads for multiple connections.Why PostgreSQL Chooses Processes?: Each connection runs in its own process, ensuring that if one session crashes, it doesn’t affect others. This design reduces the risk of memory corruption, race conditions, or resource conflicts between clients.: The process model provides a higher level of stability, as issues in one connection are contained within its process.Since each connection is isolated, PostgreSQL doesn’t need fine-grained locking on every internal data structure (as thread-based systems do). This makes the system easier to maintain, debug, and extend.While robust, this architecture does come with certain trade-offs:: Each backend process maintains its own stack and local memory for query execution. This can consume significant RAM, especially when many idle or parallel connections are open.: Handling thousands of concurrent client connections means creating thousands of OS processes. This can lead to high context-switching costs and pressure on kernel-level resources.To maximize performance while retaining the benefits of PostgreSQL’s architecture:Use a  like PgBouncerPgBouncer sits between clients and PostgreSQL, reusing a small pool of persistent connections.This drastically reduces process overhead while supporting thousands of clients.Tune  parameter in Don't allow too many concurrent processes unless your hardware can handle them.A common pattern: set  to ~200–500, and let PgBouncer manage the rest.In addition to client backends, PostgreSQL runs persistent background processes, also forked by the postmaster at startup. Each has a distinct job and helps with system maintenance and performance:Periodically flushes dirty pages from shared buffers to disk (to bound recovery time)Writes WAL (Write-Ahead Log) changes from memory to diskAutomatically cleans up dead tuples and refreshes statisticsContinuously writes dirty buffers in the background to smooth out I/O spikesHandles streaming WAL to replicas for physical/logical replication2. Write Ahead Logging (WAL)Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is one of PostgreSQL’s most critical mechanisms for ensuring data durability, consistency, crash recovery, and replication.WAL is a sequential log of all database changes, written  those changes are applied to the actual data files (the heap or index pages). This ensures that, in the event of a crash or power failure, PostgreSQL can  and restore the database to a safe and consistent state.Client executes a write operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL).PostgreSQL generates a WAL record describing the change.The WAL record is written to memory (WAL buffer).On commit, the WAL is flushed to disk (fsync)—this makes the transaction durable.The actual data files (heap pages) may be updated later, asynchronously by background processes (like the checkpointer or background writer).In case of a crash, PostgreSQL replays the WAL from the last checkpoint to recover the lost changes.: WAL replay brings the database to a consistent state after a crash. This ensures that no committed data is lost, even after a system failure.: Enables both synchronous and asynchronous replication for disaster recovery and read scaling. A replica essentially replays WAL just like crash recovery, but continuously, to stay in sync with the primary.Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR): By archiving WAL, you can restore a backup and replay WAL to a specific point in time, essentially “time-traveling” the database to a desired state.Managing WAL: Best PracticesIf unmanaged, WAL can consume significant disk space. Here are ways to handle it:archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /mnt/wal_archive/%f' to delete old WAL files.Set appropriate (e.g., , ) to balance recovery time vs. runtime I/O. to avoid prematurely removing WAL needed by standby or logical consumers.3. Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)PostgreSQL uses  to handle simultaneous transactions without requiring heavy locking. MVCC is a powerful mechanism that allows reads and writes to occur concurrently by maintaining multiple versions of a row. This ensures that every transaction sees a  of the database as it existed at the time the transaction began—regardless of ongoing changes by other users.Traditional databases often use locks to prevent conflicts between readers and writers. However, this leads to blocking and contention:Writers lock rows to prevent readers from seeing half-written dataReaders may block writers while reading dataPostgreSQL avoids this by using MVCC to isolate transactions without locking—resulting in high concurrency, better performance, and smoother scalability.When a transaction starts, PostgreSQL assigns it a unique .PostgreSQL tracks versions of rows using hidden system columns:: The transaction ID that inserted the row: The transaction ID that deleted (or updated) the rowLet’s say we have a table called :id | balance
---+---------
1  | 1000 → inserted by transaction ID 100 → it hasn’t been deleted/updated yetWhat Happens During Reads?When a transaction reads a row, it sees the version that was current at the start of the transaction:It checks  and  to determine if the row  at the time the transaction started.If another transaction later updates the row, it  with a new , leaving the original intact for other readers.BEGIN;  -- Transaction ID = 200
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;T1 sees the row with Since  and , the row is visible to T1T1 keeps using this  of the database until it commits, even if the data is updated laterWhat Happens During Writes?Writers create new versions of rows without blocking readers, ensuring high concurrency.PostgreSQL . Instead:: Adds a new row with the current transaction’s XID in : Marks the old row’s  and inserts a new row with a fresh : Only sets ; the row remains until cleanupThis design ensures —older transactions can still see the old versions of rows, even after they're updated. Readers , and writers . Each sees the world as it existed at their transaction start.Transaction 2 (T2) – A concurrent updateBEGIN;  -- Transaction ID = 201
UPDATE accounts SET balance = 1500 WHERE id = 1;Here’s what happens internally:Its  → marking it as deleted by T2Its  and So now there are  of the row:Old version: balance = 1000, xmin = 100, xmax = 201
New version: balance = 1500, xmin = 201, xmax = NULLWhat Each Transaction Sees is still active and keeps using its snapshot from the beginning:It sees the old row: It ignores the new row, because its  (which is after T1 started)The new row it just inserted: Once both transactions are done, PostgreSQL will still keep both row versions until the old one is no longer needed.Cleanup: The Role of VACUUMPostgreSQL stores all row versions in the table (heap) until it's safe to remove them. But old versions don’t disappear automatically.That’s where process comes in:Removes old row versions that are no longer visible to any transactionPrevents  by freezing old transaction IDsPostgreSQL runs  in the background by default, but tuning its frequency is critical in high-write systems.4. Query Execution PipelineWhen you run a query in PostgreSQL—whether it's a simple  or a complex join across multiple tables, it goes through a well-defined five-stage pipeline.Each stage transforms the query from raw SQL into actual database operations that return results or modify data.The Five Stages of Query ExecutionPostgreSQL takes the raw SQL string and checks it for .It then converts the query into a  — a structured, internal representation of what the query is trying to do.Think of this step as preprocessing or query transformation—reshaping the original request before planning.PostgreSQL applies rules and view expansions to the parse tree.For example, if the query targets a , the system rewrites the view reference into its underlying query.The planner generates multiple candidate execution plans for the query.It estimates the  of each plan using table statistics and selects the  one.Cost is measured in terms of CPU, I/O, and memory usage—not time directly, but an abstract "execution cost" unit.PostgreSQL  step by step.Execution is , meaning each node requests rows from its child, processes them, and passes results upward.Once the executor produces result tuples, they are  (for SELECT), or  (for INSERT/UPDATE).Key Features in PostgreSQL’s Execution Engine: For large datasets, queries can be split across multiple CPU cores.: Complex queries can be compiled at runtime for faster execution.Use the  command to analyze query plans and identify performance bottlenecks. For example:EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date > now() - interval '30 days';Indexes are essential to database performance. PostgreSQL offers a variety of index types to optimize query performance for different data types:B-tree (Default Index Type) Equality and range queries (, , , , ) Numbers, strings, dates—anything with a natural sort orderCREATE INDEX idx_price ON products(price); Simple equality comparisons ( only)Slightly faster than B-tree for some equality lookups, but limited in capabilities.CREATE INDEX idx_hash_email ON users USING HASH(email);GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) Documents or composite values (arrays, JSON, full-text search) when you need to check if a document contains a value or perform membership checks. Indexes every element inside a value (like words in a text field or keys in a JSON)-- For full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_gin_content ON articles USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', content));

-- For JSONB
CREATE INDEX idx_jsonb_data ON items USING GIN(data jsonb_path_ops);

-- For array values
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_gin ON posts USING GIN(tags);GiST (Generalized Search Tree) Complex, non-scalar data types (geospatial, ranges, fuzzy text search) Stores  or intervals and supports overlaps, proximity, containment. Underpins the PostGIS extension, range queries, and more.-- For geospatial data (via PostGIS)
CREATE INDEX idx_location_gist ON places USING GiST(geom);

-- For range types
CREATE INDEX idx_price_range ON items USING GiST(price_range);SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned GiST) Data with natural space partitioning (e.g., tries, quadtrees) Prefix searches, IP subnet matching, k-d trees-- For text prefix matching
CREATE INDEX idx_prefix ON entries USING SPGIST(title); Huge, append-only tables where data is naturally sorted (e.g., time-series)CREATE INDEX idx_log_time_brin ON logs USING BRIN(log_timestamp); allows large tables to be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces based on range, list, or hash criteria. This improves query performance by enabling , where only relevant partitions are scanned.PostgreSQL supports , which means you define partitions using standard SQL with the  clause.To create a partitioned table by date range:-- Create the partitioned parent table
CREATE TABLE measurements (
  city_id    INT NOT NULL,
  logdate    DATE NOT NULL,
  peaktemp   INT,
  unitsales  INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);

-- Create child partitions for each year
CREATE TABLE measurements_2024 PARTITION OF measurements
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');

CREATE TABLE measurements_2025 PARTITION OF measurements
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-12-31');When you insert into , PostgreSQL automatically routes the row to the correct partition based on the  value.Splits data by ranges of values (e.g., dates, numbers).Divides data by discrete values (e.g., region codes {“APAC”, “EMEA”, ...}).Distributes rows evenly using a hash function (when range/list isn’t practical or balanced).Partitioning reduces query times by avoiding full table scans. Ideal for time-series data or datasets that can be logically grouped (e.g., by region or category). is the process of transforming PostgreSQL’s  into  like:INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');

UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 42;

DELETE FROM payments WHERE id = 7;It allows changes from the WAL to be streamed in a logical format, making it useful for replication and Change Data Capture (CDC). How Logical Decoding Works?PostgreSQL WAL contains all changes, but in a binary, low-level formatLogical decoding interprets WAL into high-level row changesThe output is emitted using an , such as: (used for PostgreSQL logical replication) (outputs changes as JSON) (outputs Protocol Buffers) (for debugging/logging)A  is created to:Track how much of the WAL has been consumedPrevent PostgreSQL from deleting WAL segments that are still needed by a consumerChange Data Capture (CDC): Stream inserts/updates/deletes to message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) Sync changes into a data warehouse (like BigQuery or Snowflake) Trigger downstream services on data changes Sync tables across PostgreSQL instances (or even to MongoDB/MySQL with external tools) Logical decoding requires extensions like wal2json for specific output formats, as it’s not built-in by default.One of PostgreSQL’s greatest strengths is its . From its inception, PostgreSQL was designed to be , enabling users to extend its functionality without modifying core source code.This has turned PostgreSQL from a traditional relational database into a true —capable of powering everything from analytics to full-text search, machine learning, and distributed systems.An  in PostgreSQL is a package of additional functionality that can include:SQL objects (functions, types, tables, operators)Procedural language supportNative C code for performanceBackground workers or hooks into the core engineOnce installed, extensions behave like built-in features, seamlessly integrated into the database engine.Extensions can be created by the community or bundled with PostgreSQL. To install one:CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;Extensions live in the  directory and are managed through , , and .: Adds  for hashing, encryption, and password handling: Enables vector , useful for machine learning and AI applications: Turns PostgreSQL into a , supporting geometry, GIS queries, spatial indexing: Enables , allowing you to shard and scale out across multiple nodesThis flexibility makes PostgreSQL adaptable to a wide range of applications, from traditional relational databases to specialized data processing systems.PostgreSQL’s  gathers real-time data on database activity, helping you monitor and optimize performance. There are two main types of statistics PostgreSQL collects:Cumulative Activity Statistics: Used for , , and : Used by the  to optimize execution plansCumulative Statistics System (pg_stat views)These statistics are stored in * and reflect what’s happened since the server started or since stats were last reset.: Shows live queries and their status.Shows table-level read/write/VACUUM stats.Tracks index usage (helps detect unused indexes).: Tracks execution metrics for SQL statements, helping identify slow or resource-intensive queries.Example: Identify Top Slow QueriesSELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 5;Planner Statistics (ANALYZE statistics)This refers to the data collected by the  command (automatically run by autovacuum or manually by DBAs) about the contents of tables.These stats are stored in the  system catalog and are critical for query planning.What PostgreSQL collects per column:List of most common values (MCVs) and their frequenciesA  of value distributionWith  (using ), PostgreSQL can also store: between columns (e.g., if ) estimates for combinations of columnsPostgreSQL’s query planner uses these stats to:Estimate  (how many rows a WHERE clause will match)Choose between , , , or Allocate memory for  or If  finds that  occurs in 90% of rows, the planner may avoid using an index because the query isn’t selective.PostgreSQL’s robust architecture and feature set make it a powerful choice for developers. From its process-based model and MVCC for concurrency to advanced features like logical decoding and extensions, it offers the flexibility and reliability needed for modern applications.To take your understanding further, explore:By mastering these concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to design, optimize, and troubleshoot PostgreSQL databases, ensuring your applications run efficiently and reliably.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The application is released on an internal GitHub page with compressed files and an executable. I needed a way to check the latest release artifacts in GitHub and download them.Let’s find out how all this works!You will need to download and install a couple of packages to make this all work. Specifically, you will need the following:You can install both of these using pip. Open up your terminal and run the following command:python -m pip install PyGithub requestsOnce this finishes, you should have everything you need to get the latest GitHub release assets.Downloading the Latest Release AssetsThe only other item you will need to make this work is a GitHub personal access token. You will need to create one of those. Depending on your use case, you may want to create what amounts to a bot account to make your token last a little longer.The next step is to write some code. Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file. Then add the following code to it:import requests

from github import Auth
from github import Github
from pathlib import Path

token =  "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers["Authorization"] = f"token {token}"
headers["Accept"] = "application/octet-stream"
session = requests.Session()

auth = Auth.Token(token)  # Token can be None if the repo is public
g = Github(auth=auth)

# Use this one if you have an internal GitHub instance:
#g = Github(auth=auth, base_url="https://YOUR_COMPANY_URL/api/v3")

repo = g.get_repo("user/repo")  # Replace with the proper user and repo combo
for release in repo.get_releases():
    # Releases are returned with the latest first
    print(release)
    break

for asset in release.get_assets():
    print(asset.name)
    destination = Path(r"C:\Temp") / asset.name
    response = session.get(asset.url, stream=True, headers=headers)
    with open(destination, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(1024*1024):
            f.write(chunk)
    print(f"Downloaded asset to {destination}")
The first half of this code is your imports and boilerplate for creating a GitHub authentication token and a requests Session object. If you work for a company and have an internal GitHub instance, see the commented-out code and use that instead for your GitHub authentication.The next step is to get the GitHub repository and loop over its releases. By default, the iterable will return the items with the latest first and the oldest last. So you break out of the loop on the first release found to get the latest.At this point, you loop over the assets in the release. In my case, I wanted to find an asset that was an executable and download it, but this code downloads all the assets.This is a pretty short example, but it demonstrates one of the many things you can do with the handy PyGitHub package. You should check it out if you need to script other tasks in GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI 2027 scenario (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/139</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/139/changelog-news-139.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel Kokotajlo and the AI Futures Project lays out a potential scenario of superhuman AI’s impact, Liam ERD generates beautiful, interactive ER diagrams from your database, Mozilla takes on Gmail with “Thundermail”, algernon explains why grepping remains terrible & Vitor M. de Sousa Pereira rans on the insanity of being a software engineer.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

But so far the open-weights models have received an initial mixed-to-negative reception from the AI community, highlighting a familiar tension between AI marketing and user experience."The vibes around llama 4 so far are decidedly mid," independent AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. Willison often checks the community pulse around open source and open weights AI releases in particular.While Meta positions Llama 4 in competition with closed-model giants like OpenAI and Google, the company continues to use the term "open source" despite licensing restrictions that prevent truly open use.

You want to understand how it works, so you start looking for a place to begin unfolding it. With each corner of the paper you peel back, you notice an even more intricate structure underneath. So you unfold that too, and find even more fine detail underneath yet again. You start to wonder how many layers it can have, and marvel at the intricacy. You remember at the start, when you already thought it was complex, but you had no idea how elaborate it really was. That is the experience of playing Blue Prince.It can be difficult to describe a game like this, in which so much of the design is about curiosity and discovery. But at its most basic level, Blue Prince is a roguelike puzzle game built around exploring a shapeshifting manor house. The executor of the Mount Holly estate has left it to you, but it will only become yours if you reach the mysterious Room 46. You cannot spend the night inside the house, so you set up camp just outside the grounds. After each day, the rooms reset and all of the doors close again. The exact layout of the manor is never the same twice. It takes place in first-person, making it an unfolding puzzle box that you live inside.You start each day at the entrance, the bottom-center square of a 5x9 grid, faced with three doors. Each time you interact with a door, you're faced with three choices of which room to "draft" on the other side. Some rooms are dead ends, others are straight pathways, others only bend, and so on. You have a limited number of steps, and crossing the threshold into a new room ticks down one of them. From the start, you understand the objective to be that carving a pathway using these interlocking pieces, without expending too many steps, will successfully lead to the top of the 5x9 grid, to the Antechamber where there sits the entrance to Room 46. At this point, Blue Prince feels very much like a prestige board game, complete with a grid and tiles to place.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Shiny to Strategic: The Maturation of AI Across Industries // David Cox // #303</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/From-Shiny-to-Strategic-The-Maturation-of-AI-Across-Industries--David-Cox--303-e316r9c</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100936428/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-3-7%2F397945233-44100-2-5bc754e285f14.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 03:31:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Shiny to Strategic: The Maturation of AI Across Industries // MLOps Podcast #303 with David Cox, VP of Data Science; Assistant Director of Research at RethinkFirst; Institute of Applied Behavioral Science.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn  Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletterShiny new objects are made available to artificial intelligence(AI) practitioners daily. For many who are not AI practitioners, the release of ChatGPT in 2022 was their first contact with modern AI technology. This led to a flurry of funding and excitement around how AI might improve their bottom line. Two years on, the novelty of AI has worn off for many companies but remains a strategic initiative. This strategic nuance has led to two patterns that suggest a maturation of the AI conversation across industries. First, conversations seem to be pivoting from "Are we doing [the shiny new thing]" to serious analysis of the ROI from things built. This reframe places less emphasis on simply adopting new technologies for the sake of doing so and more emphasis on the optimal stack to maximize return relative to cost. Second, conversations are shifting to emphasize market differentiation. That is, anyone can build products that wrap around LLMs. In competitive markets, creating products and functionality that all your competitors can also build is a poor business strategy (unless having a particular thing is industry standard). Creating a competitive advantage requires companies to think strategically about their unique data assets and what they can build that their competitors cannot. // BioDr. David Cox can formally lay claim to being a bioethicist (master's degree), a board-certified behavior analyst at the doctoral level, a behavioral economist (post-doc training), and a full-stack data scientist (post-doc training).

Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler.kube-scheduler-simulator is a  for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions.
This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions.It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity)
and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins.The scheduler often appears as a black box,
composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives.
Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers.Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment.Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge.
There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests.
More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.
Actually, many bugs are found by users after shipping the release,
even in the upstream kube-scheduler.Having a development or sandbox environment for testing the scheduler — or, indeed, any Kubernetes controllers — is a common practice.
However, this approach falls short of capturing all the potential scenarios that might arise in a production cluster
because a development cluster is often much smaller with notable differences in workload sizes and scaling dynamics.
It never sees the exact same use or exhibits the same behavior as its production counterpart.The kube-scheduler-simulator aims to solve those problems.
It enables users to test their scheduling constraints, scheduler configurations,
and custom plugins while checking every detailed part of scheduling decisions.
It also allows users to create a simulated cluster environment, where they can test their scheduler
with the same resources as their production cluster without affecting actual workloads.Features of the kube-scheduler-simulatorThe kube-scheduler-simulator’s core feature is its ability to expose the scheduler's internal decisions.
The scheduler operates based on the scheduling framework,
using various plugins at different extension points,
filter nodes (Filter phase), score nodes (Score phase), and ultimately determine the best node for the Pod.The simulator allows users to create Kubernetes resources and observe how each plugin influences the scheduling decisions for Pods.
This visibility helps users understand the scheduler’s workings and define appropriate scheduling constraints.Inside the simulator, a debuggable scheduler runs instead of the vanilla scheduler.
This debuggable scheduler outputs the results of each scheduler plugin at every extension point to the Pod’s annotations like the following manifest shows
and the web front end formats/visualizes the scheduling results based on these annotations.This debuggable scheduler can also run standalone, for example, on any Kubernetes cluster or in integration tests.
This would be useful to custom plugin developers who want to test their plugins or examine their custom scheduler in a real cluster with better debuggability.The simulator as a better dev clusterAs mentioned earlier, with a limited set of tests, it is impossible to predict every possible scenario in a real-world cluster.
Typically, users will test the scheduler in a small, development cluster before deploying it to production, hoping that no issues arise.The simulator’s importing feature
provides a solution by allowing users to simulate deploying a new scheduler version in a production-like environment without impacting their live workloads.By continuously syncing between a production cluster and the simulator, users can safely test a new scheduler version with the same resources their production cluster handles.
Once confident in its performance, they can proceed with the production deployment, reducing the risk of unexpected issues.: Examine if scheduling constraints (for example, PodAffinity, PodTopologySpread) work as intended.: Assess how a cluster would behave with changes to the scheduler configuration.Scheduler plugin developers: Test a custom scheduler plugins or extenders, use the debuggable scheduler in integration tests or development clusters, or use the syncing feature for testing within a production-like environment.The simulator only requires Docker to be installed on a machine; a Kubernetes cluster is not necessary.git clone git@github.com:kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-simulator.git
cd kube-scheduler-simulator
make docker_up
You can then access the simulator's web UI at .The simulator has been maintained by dedicated volunteer engineers, overcoming many challenges to reach its current form.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saint Petersburg: Putin&apos;s Hometown</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/saint-petersburg-putins-hometown</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67eff266f185b2a87f9e9263/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=jdSQ7w6OObfx_AUx_Arz5R1WvjYiC_ebKctu-So3IdU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founded by Peter the Great, the city of Saint Petersburg was built to rival the majesty of any capital in Europe.

Now I&apos;m Cheering for Better Linux Hardware</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/04/06/0037234/forget-snow-sequoia-now-im-cheering-for-better-linux-hardware?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was long-time Slashdot reader uninet who argued "Apple Needs a Snow Sequoia." (That is, Apple needs an upgrade to MacOS Sequoia that's like it's earlier "Snow Leopard" upgrade to "Leopard" OS — an upgrade that's "all about how little it added and how much it took away".) 
"My recent column on Apple's declining software quality hit a nerve..." he writes in a follow-up. "So why do any of us put up with software that grows increasingly buggy?" 

"One word: hardware. And that's where I'd love to see someone help Linux take the next step."

Apple knows how to turn out very good quality pieces of hardware and, for many purposes, stands alone. That's been largely true for the last couple of decades. The half-decade of Apple Silicon has cemented this position. At any price point Apple contends, Macs, iPads and iPhones are either without peers or at the top of the market in build quality and processing power... [I]f only there were hardware that was as good and worked together as well as Apple's, jumping ship to Linux would be awfully attractive at this juncture... 

For Apple aficionados troubled by the state of MacOS, the modern GNOME desktop on Linux beckons as a more faithful implementation of the ideals of MacOS than current MacOS does. GNOME is painstakingly consistent across its different apps and exudes the minimalist philosophy with which Apple's hardware shines... Now is a perfect moment for a modern Linux push to take that wind back. What it needs, though, is to solve its remaining weakness on the hardware side. One of the giants of electronics manufacturing, tired of being stuck between the Microsoft and Apple ecosystems, would only need to decide to commit the resources necessary to solve the hardware puzzle... 

ChromeOS has grown to the extent it does because there is hardware designed for it. Take that and carry it further by making it good hardware utilizing the best Linux software and you'd have something disruptive... Initially, the hardware could be "good enough" for the software, much as Apple's software today is merely "good enough" for the hardware. Iterating from there could lead to a genuine third way of computing. 

They titled their piece, "I Want a Better Mac, so I'm Cheering for a Better Linux." (Wondering if Dell or Sony could be the one to supply that good hardware...) "I say this not as someone who thinks Linux will ever dominate the personal computing world, but as someone who wants to see a spark of creativity and push beyond mediocrity in it again. 
"Apple needs a real competitor, one alternatives such as GNOME on Linux could actually be, if only the hardware rose to the occasion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does Pain Threshold Increase After You Laugh? | Horizon: The Science of Laughter | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfGVyaYyu6s</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JfGVyaYyu6s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 15:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Professor Robin Dunbar is a British anthropologist who causes people pain because he claims it throws light on why we laugh.

- Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) that lets unprivileged processes restrict themselves. 

- It's been in the kernel since 5.13, but the API is awkward to use directly. 

- It always annoyed the hell out of me to run random binaries from the internet without any real control over what they can access. 

So they've rolled their own solution, according to Thursday's submission to Slashdot:


I just released Landrun, a Go-based CLI tool that wraps Linux Landlock (5.13+) to sandbox any process without root, containers, or seccomp. Think firejail, but minimal and kernel-native. Supports fine-grained file access (ro/rw/exec) and TCP port restrictions (6.7+). No daemons, no YAML, just flags.

Example (where --rox allows read-only access with execution to specified path):

 # landrun --rox /usr touch /tmp/filetouch: cannot touch '/tmp/file': Permission denied# landrun --rox /usr --rw /tmp touch /tmp/file# 

It's MIT-licensed, easy to audit, and now supports systemd services.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1608 - 1813: The Complex History Of Canada&apos;s Indigenous Nations And More</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8s6U9NuUJE</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n8s6U9NuUJE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 5 Apr 2025 21:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hundreds of Indigenous nations with advanced cultures already live in Canada when French and English colonizers arrive and fight for land claims.

The feature "would designate a specific directory inside of Python package metadata (".dist-info/sboms") as a directory where build backends and other tools can store SBOM documents that describe components within the package beyond the top-level component."

The goal of this project is to make bundled dependencies measurable by software analysis tools like vulnerability scanning, license compliance, and static analysis tools. Bundled dependencies are common for scientific computing and AI packages, but also generally in packages that use multiple programming languages like C, C++, Rust, and JavaScript. The PEP has been moved to Provisional Status, meaning the PEP sponsor is doing a final review before tools can begin implementing the PEP ahead of its final acceptance into changing Python packaging standards. Seth has begun implementing code that tools can use when adopting the PEP, such as a project which abstracts different Linux system package managers functionality to reverse a file path into the providing package metadata. 

Security developer-in-residence Seth Larson will be speaking about this project at PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh, PA in a talk titled "Phantom Dependencies: is your requirements.txt haunted?" 

Meanwhile InfoWorld reports that newly approved Python Enhancement Proposal 751 will also give Python a standard lock file format.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What do snails look like under the microscope?🔬 #Snail #Animals #Nature #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRpErF30-JA</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gRpErF30-JA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 5 Apr 2025 15:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Best of Earth Science: http://bit.ly/EarthLabOriginals

It would do just about what a contemporary store-bought computer could do. That time is long gone. Modern computers are made of hundreds of huge complex chips with no public datasheets and many hundreds of watts of power supplied to them over complex power delivery topologies. It does not help that modern operating systems require gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage, and always-on internet connectivity to properly spy on you. But what if one tried to fit a modern computer into a kit that could be easily assembled at home? What if the kit only had three chips, each with only 8 pins? Can it be done? Yes. The system runs a custom MIPS emulator written in ARMv6 assembly and includes a custom bootloader that supports firmware updates via FAT16-formatted SD cards. Clever pin-sharing hacks allow all components (RAM, SD, serial I/O) to work despite the 6 usable I/O pins. Overclocked to up to 150MHz, the board boots into a full Linux shell in about a minute and performs at ~1.65MHz MIPS-equivalent speed.
 
It's not fast, writes Dmitry, but it's fully functional -- you can edit files, compile code, and even install Debian packages. A kit may be made available if a partner is found.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Trump’s Tariffs Will Transform Global Trade?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpKe_HbVG64</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IpKe_HbVG64?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 23:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://surfshark.com/boyle for 4 extra months of Surfshark

How will Trump's Liberation Day Tariffs transform global trade?

It allows decentralized networks operated by threat actors to hide their infrastructure and survive takedown attempts that would otherwise succeed. Fast flux works by cycling through a range of IP addresses and domain names that these botnets use to connect to the Internet. In some cases, IPs and domain names change every day or two; in other cases, they change almost hourly. The constant flux complicates the task of isolating the true origin of the infrastructure. It also provides redundancy. By the time defenders block one address or domain, new ones have already been assigned.“This technique poses a significant threat to national security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection,” the NSA, FBI, and their counterparts from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand warned Thursday. “Malicious cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS) records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control (C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Streaming Ecosystem Complexities and Cost Management // Rohit Agrawal // #302</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Streaming-Ecosystem-Complexities-and-Cost-Management--Rohit-Agrawal--302-e31410r</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100843995/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-3-4%2F397832723-44100-2-3289384441a76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 18:42:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Streaming Ecosystem Complexities and Cost Management // MLOps Podcast #302 with Rohit Agrawal, Director of Engineering at Tecton.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter Demetrios talks with Rohit Agrawal, Director of Engineering at Tecton, about the challenges and future of streaming data in ML.

Despite enduring what felt like month-long panic attacks leading up to this ordeal, I only realized how bad everything had gotten when I woke up in the hospital, body draped in a violently purple hospital gown that I still have no recollection of putting on. I spent a couple days and a thousand or so dollars in that hospital room, an uncomfortable combination of dazed and defeated, mostly. But I also remember feeling absurdly grateful. I was in a space where nothing was expected of me. I had been completely removed from the rest of the living, breathing, working population. It was as if I didn't exist. And it's terrifying to think about how I wanted that back then.Prior to my rejoining society, I was given a choice: I could seek further treatment and attempt to address my various ailments, or I could walk out those doors largely unchanged (apart from being hundreds of dollars poorer). Treatment meant time and money: two things I never felt I had enough of. But as I considered my next steps, the psychiatrist across from me set down her clipboard and told me something I'll never forget."If you don't make time to take care of yourself, your body will make time for you--and you probably won't like when or how it does."Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why It&apos;s So Hard to Exploit Geothermal Energy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZsjAramjb4</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5ZsjAramjb4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 14:12:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Only a few countries in the world are able to make use of geothermal energy.

Planet Earth is the jewel of the solar system—the shimmery blue oceans, the verdant green forests, the wispy whimsical cloud formations. Saturn is the only competitor for most gorgeous planet with that giant ring system. Hmm… what if we could put the jewel of the Earth in its own ring? Then no contest.  Well, there’s an extremely good chance that Earth once DID have a ring system. At least, that’s the proposal by a recent study that has evidence that a mysterious burst in meteor activity nearly half a billion years ago was actually caused by that ancient ring system collapsing onto the Earth. And, you know, if we had a ring once maybe we can have one again.

Oracle staff informed some clients this week that the attacker gained access to usernames, passkeys and encrypted passwords, according to the people, who spoke on condition that they not be identified because they're not authorized to discuss the matter. Oracle also told them that the FBI and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike are investigating the incident, according to the people, who added that the attacker sought an extortion payment from the company.

Have we uncovered new evidence of a Roman Siege of an iron age hill fort? 

In this new exclusive documentary, Historian Tristan Hughes re-joins the hunt for the mysterious Ninth Legion.

Joining forces with Historian and Archaeologist Simon Elliot,  Tristan sets off on a road trip to three key Roman sites, a roman marching camp, iron age hill fort and site of a third previously undiscovered Roman camp high up in the Derbyshire Dales. 

Three sites that combined with incredible new artefacts could attest to a long lost ancient battle between Roman forces and Iron Age Briton's.

Developed by Compulsion Games--the team behind Contrast and We Happy Few--South of Midnight builds on the Canadian studio's strengths: intriguing narrative concepts, perturbing atmosphere, and memorable characters. Much like Contrast and We Happy Few, South of Midnight's gameplay pales in comparison to its narrative elements, but Compulsion Games' latest effort is its strongest game by far, delving into a setting and lore rarely seen in major video games to tell an incredible story.In South of Midnight, you play as Hazel, a teenage track star who lives in Prospero, a town in the American Deep South. After a hurricane sweeps her home away with her mother inside, Hazel vows to track down and save her. However, she soon discovers that the storm has not only transformed the rural town and surrounding swampland into a dangerous jungle gym but also knocked loose a lot of lingering dark magic, making this journey all the more perilous. Hazel quickly learns that she is a weaver, a person born with the innate ability to see the underlying strands that tie the world together and can also knot into terrifying monstrosities in places where powerful negative emotions like grief, rage, and fear gather. Armed with surprisingly sharp textile-spinning tools, Hazel's search for her mom sees her stumble across numerous legendary spirits inspired by real-world myths, which she can help by uncovering the trauma that created them and doing her best to capture those feelings in magical bottles so that they can be taken away. To whom or where? That's just another mystery to solve.It's a strong story that dips into Southern Gothic themes and cultivates a sense of dread that you cannot fully dismiss, for each of its tales exists in that unnerving middle ground of clearly being fantastical whilst pulling from real-world terrors like bigotry and child abuse. And when confronted with absurd displays of evil cruelty or agonizing tragedy in these stories, you can't easily discern where exactly reality ends and the myth begins--the pain in these gothic tales cling to you, much as they do to Hazel, and keep South of Midnight emotionally compelling all the way through.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The legend of Beowulf and the revenge of the swamp beast - Iseult Gillespie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43qXqa8Q8o4</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/43qXqa8Q8o4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 3 Apr 2025 15:01:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the classic poem, “Beowulf,” which follows a heroic prince as he fights to free a kingdom from the monster Grendel.

--

An epic written in Old English, “Beowulf” is known for its haunting monsters, dream-like language, and paranoid perspective, where violent threats are always waiting on the fringes of society. The action follows Beowulf, a prince of Geats, who travels to aid a kingdom in freeing itself from a monster’s reign of terror. Why is this poem considered a classic? Iseult Gillespie traces the hero’s tale.

A service might become unresponsive. A network call might time out. The question is not  these things will happen—but .As engineers, our job is to design systems that embrace this reality and gracefully handle failures.In this article, we’ll cover: in distributed systems for handling failuresDistributed systems involve multiple independent components communicating over a network.And each of these introduces potential failure points:The network is the most unreliable component in any distributed architecture.Even if two services are running in the same data center, network glitches can still occur.A single machine (or container) can go down due to:In distributed systems, every node is potentially a single point of failure unless redundancy is built in.A service may fail even if the machine it's running on is healthy.Code bugs (null pointers, unhandled exceptions)Deadlocks or resource exhaustionMemory leaks causing the service to slow down or crashMisconfigurations (e.g., bad environment variables)Caches (like Redis or Memcached)External APIs (payment gateways, 3rd-party auth providers)Message queues (like Kafka, RabbitMQ)If any of these are unavailable, misbehaving, or inconsistent, it can cause cascading failures across the system. Your checkout service calls the payment API, which calls a bank API, which calls a fraud-detection microservice. Each hop is a potential point of failure.Data replication across systems (like DB sharding, caching layers, or eventual consistency models) can introduce:Lost updates due to race conditions A user updates their address, but due to replication lag, the shipping system fetches the old address and sends the package to the wrong place.6. Configuration & Deployment ErrorsFailures aren't always caused by bugs—they’re often caused by mis-configurations and human errors:Misconfigured load balancersMissing secrets in the environmentIncompatible library updatesDeleting the wrong databaseRolling out a new version without backward compatibilityAccording to multiple incident postmortems (e.g., AWS, Google), a large number of production outages are triggered by —not code.7. Time-Related Issues (Clock Skew, Timeouts)Distributed systems often rely on time for:But system clocks on different machines can drift out of sync (called ), which can wreak havoc.Machine A: 12:00:01
Machine B: 11:59:59A token generated on Machine B might be considered “expired” when validated by Machine A, even if it was just created.Let’s look at the  that make your system resilient when parts of it inevitably fail.1. Set Timeouts for Remote CallsA timeout is the maximum time you’re willing to wait for a response from another service. If a service doesn’t respond in that time window, you abort the operation and handle it as a failure.Every network call whether it’s to a REST API, database, message queue, or third-party service should have a timeout.Waiting too long can hog threads, pile up requests, and cause cascading failures. It’s better to fail fast and try again (smartly).To be effective, timeouts should be:Short enough to fail fastLong enough for the request to realistically completeVary depending on the operation (e.g., reads vs writes, internal vs external calls)A good practice is to base timeouts on the service’s typical latency (e.g., use the 99th percentile response time or service SLO, plus a safety margin)​. If your downstream service has a p99 latency of 450ms:Recommended Timeout = 450ms + 50ms buffer = 500msThis ensures most successful responses arrive before the timeout, while truly slow or hung requests get aborted.Never use infinite or unbounded timeoutsDon’t assume the caller will enforce a timeout for you2.

In this episode we travel along the vast grassland corridor of the steppe, to hear one of the most remarkable and unlikely stories from medieval history – the story of the Mongol Empire. Find out how this group of nomadic horse riders united the peoples of the Mongolian steppe, and forged them into a truly unique kind of state. Discover how they conquered much of the lands of Eurasia, and brought the distant cultures of China, Persia, the Middle East and Europe into contact.

Automated bots seeking AI model training data for LLMs have been vacuuming up terabytes of data, growing the foundation's bandwidth used for downloading multimedia content by 50 percent since January 2024. It’s a scenario familiar across the free and open source software (FOSS) community, as we've previously detailed.The Foundation hosts not only Wikipedia but also platforms like Wikimedia Commons, which offers 144 million media files under open licenses. For decades, this content has powered everything from search results to school projects. But since early 2024, AI companies have dramatically increased automated scraping through direct crawling, APIs, and bulk downloads to feed their hungry AI models. This exponential growth in non-human traffic has imposed steep technical and financial costs—often without the attribution that helps sustain Wikimedia’s volunteer ecosystem.The impact isn’t theoretical. The foundation says that when former US President Jimmy Carter died in December 2024, his Wikipedia page predictably drew millions of views. But the real stress came when users simultaneously streamed a 1.5-hour video of a 1980 debate from Wikimedia Commons. The surge doubled Wikimedia’s normal network traffic, temporarily maxing out several of its Internet connections. Wikimedia engineers quickly rerouted traffic to reduce congestion, but the event revealed a deeper problem: The baseline bandwidth had already been consumed largely by bots scraping media at scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2298 - Kurt Metzger</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJbKgC_bMpI</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bJbKgC_bMpI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Apr 2025 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kurt Metzger is a stand-up comic, writer, and host of the "Can't Get Right with Kurt Metzger" podcast.

"It doesn't mean that the AI is doing the software engineering job.... authorship is still going to be human," Scott said. 

According to Scott, developers will shift from writing code directly to guiding AI through prompts and instructions. "We go from being an input master (programming languages) to a prompt master (AI orchestrator)," he said. Scott said the current AI systems have significant memory limitations, making them "awfully transactional," but predicted improvements within the next year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is One Of The Weirdest Plants You&apos;ll Ever See | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi9WSrP_bew</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oi9WSrP_bew?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Apr 2025 16:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Grown all over the mountains of southern Mexico, "giant maize" and its mysterious mucus could help feed the planet and end farming’s toxic reliance on chemical fertilisers.

South Korea is heading toward a demographic collapse unlike anything the world has seen before. With the lowest fertility rate ever recorded and a rapidly aging population, the country faces a future of economic decline, shrinking cities, cultural erosion, and a vanishing workforce. 
By 2060, nearly half of South Koreans could be over the age of 65, and entire regions may be abandoned as the population continues to shrink.
How did South Korea reach this point? Why might it no longer be possible to reverse the trend? And what does this mean for other countries on a similar path?

Like many others, it was planted by Allied soldiers in the dead of night. A hollow replica of the real tree that stood there before. But why did they do it? What are they made of? And how did these trees help to change the face of conflict forever?

During the First World War, Allied soldiers needed a way to see without being seen. The solution was the camouflage tree, a fake piece of shrubbery with an observation post hidden inside. Initially a French invention, the camouflage tree would allow Allied soldiers to keep track of enemy movements from a concealed elevated position.

 package might have encountered some of
its various pitfalls. Go 1.24 introduces a new way to write benchmarks that’s just
as easy to use, but at the same time far more robust:
.Traditionally, Go benchmarks are written using a loop from 0 to :func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
Using  instead is a trivial change:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for b.Loop() {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
 has many benefits:It prevents unwanted compiler optimizations within the benchmark loop.It automatically excludes setup and cleanup code from benchmark timing.Code can’t accidentally depend on the total number of iterations or the current
iteration.These were all easy mistakes to make with -style benchmarks that would
silently result in bogus benchmark results. As an added bonus, -style
benchmarks even complete in less time!Let’s explore the advantages of  and how to effectively utilize it.Old benchmark loop problemsBefore Go 1.24, while the basic structure of a benchmark was simple, more sophisticated
benchmarks required more care:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  b.ResetTimer() // if setup may be expensive
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
    ... use sinks or accumulation to prevent dead-code elimination ...
  }
  b.StopTimer() // if cleanup or reporting may be expensive
  ... cleanup ...
  ... report ...
}
If setup or cleanup are non-trivial, the developer needs to surround the benchmark loop
with  and/or  calls. These are easy to forget, and even if the
developer remembers they may be necessary, it can be difficult to judge whether setup or
cleanup are “expensive enough” to require them.Without these, the  package can only time the entire benchmark function. If a
benchmark function omits them, the setup and cleanup code will be included in the overall
time measurement, silently skewing the final benchmark result.There is another, more subtle pitfall that requires deeper understanding:
(Example source)func isCond(b byte) bool {
  if b%3 == 1 && b%7 == 2 && b%17 == 11 && b%31 == 9 {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

func BenchmarkIsCondWrong(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    isCond(201)
  }
}
In this example, the user might observe  executing in sub-nanosecond
time. CPUs are fast, but not that fast! This seemingly anomalous result stems
from the fact that  is inlined, and since its result is never used, the
compiler eliminates it as dead code. As a result, this benchmark doesn’t measure 
at all; it measures how long it takes to do nothing. In this case, the sub-nanosecond
result is a clear red flag, but in more complex benchmarks, partial dead-code elimination
can lead to results that look reasonable but still aren’t measuring what was intended.Unlike a -style benchmark,  is able to track when it is first called
in a benchmark when the final iteration ends. The  at the loop’s start
and  at its end are integrated into , eliminating the need
to manually manage the benchmark timer for setup and cleanup code.Furthermore, the Go compiler now detects loops where the condition is just a call to
 and prevents dead code elimination within the loop. In Go 1.24, this is
implemented by disallowing inlining into the body of such a loop, but we plan to
improve this in the future.Another nice feature of  is its one-shot ramp-up approach. With a -style
benchmark, the testing package must call the benchmark function several times with different
values of , ramping up until the measured time reached a threshold. In contrast, 
can simply run the benchmark loop until it reaches the time threshold, and only needs to call
the benchmark function once. Internally,  still uses a ramp-up process to amortize
measurement overhead, but this is hidden from the caller and can be more efficient.Certain constraints of the -style loop still apply to the -style
loop. It remains the user’s responsibility to manage the timer within the benchmark loop,
when necessary:
(Example source)func BenchmarkSortInts(b *testing.B) {
  ints := make([]int, N)
  for b.Loop() {
    b.StopTimer()
    fillRandomInts(ints)
    b.StartTimer()
    slices.Sort(ints)
  }
}
In this example, to benchmark the in-place sorting performance of ,a
randomly initialized array is required for each iteration. The user must still
manually manage the timer in such cases.Furthermore, there still needs to be exactly one such loop in the benchmark function body
(a -style loop cannot coexist with a -style loop), and every iteration of the
loop should do the same thing.The  method is now the preferred way to write benchmarks:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  for b.Loop() {
    // optional timer control for in-loop setup/cleanup
    ... code to measure ...
  }
  ... cleanup ...
}
 offers faster, more accurate, and
more intuitive benchmarking.A huge thank you to everyone in the community who provided feedback on the proposal
issue and reported bugs as this feature was released! I’m also grateful to Eli
Bendersky for his helpful blog summaries. And finally a big thank you to Austin Clements,
Cherry Mui and Michael Pratt for their review, thoughtful work on the design options and
documentation improvements.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice sit down with planetary scientist Rick Binzel, the creator of the Torino Scale, to discuss asteroid hazards, the results of the asteroid sample return, and the search for Planet 9.

Rick, a former MIT professor and OSIRIS-REx investigator, has been obsessed with asteroids since he published his first paper at age 15. He and Neil go way back—both attended the same nocturnal astronomy camp, where they spent their nights scanning the cosmos. Learn how Rick helped measure Pluto’s moon transiting in front of the dwarf planet—revealing Pluto’s real size for the first time.

We break down the Torino Scale, a 10-point system that categorizes asteroid impact risk. What does it mean when an asteroid has a 1.3% chance of hitting Earth? How do astronomers refine those probabilities over time? We discuss YR-4, an asteroid with a fluctuating impact risk, and the cosmic game of uncertainty. Why do asteroid impact predictions sometimes look like a spaghetti string of possibilities?

Then, we turn to Apophis, the “God of Chaos” asteroid that will pass closer than some satellites in 2029. With OSIRIS-APEX set to visit it post-flyby, what can we learn about its composition? Plus, we get the latest on the OSIRIS-REx mission—what did its asteroid sample reveal about the origins of life?

And finally, is there a hidden ninth planet lurking beyond Pluto? Some scientists see hints in the Kuiper Belt, while Chuck Nice has his own theory: a giant alien mothership. Neil and Rick debate what it would take to confirm (or debunk) Planet 9’s existence. All this and more, on StarTalk!

--

For millennia, livestock farmers strategically guided animals to seasonal grazing areas. This mobile way of life, known as pastoralism, provided them with wealth, social status, and political independence into the 20th century. But in the last century, political and economic policies have worked against these communities. Take a closer look at the challenges of modern pastoralism.

By default, Textual will arrange your widgets starting at the top of the screen and appending them in a vertically oriented stack. Each GUI or TUI toolkit provides a way to lay out your widgets. Textual is no different in this respect. They use an object called a .You can use containers to create the following types of layouts:You will be learning how to use all three of these types of layouts. You will also learn how to add more widgets at runtime.Creating a Vertical LayoutThe default orientation in Textual is to arrange widgets vertically. You don’t even need to use a CSS file to apply this orientation.But what does a vertical layout mean anyway? A vertical layout is when you add widgets to your application vertically, from top to bottom. Here is an illustration of what that might look like:Adding widgets to a Textual application will lay out the widgets similarly to the image above. If you want to see that for yourself, then open up your Python editor and create a new file named `vertical.py`.Then enter the following code into your new script:# vertical.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class VerticalApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = VerticalApp()
    app.run()Now open up a terminal and run your code. When you do so, you will see three buttons onscreen, with the topmost being your “OK” button and the bottom being the “Go!” button.Here is a screenshot of the application to give you an idea of what it looks like:
You can change the widget size, color, and more using each widget’s  attribute, but using CSS is simpler. Let’s update the code above to use a  file:# verical_css.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class VerticalApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "vertical.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = VerticalApp()
    app.run()Now that you are referring to a CSS file, you should go ahead and write one. If you don’t, you will get an error when you attempt to run the code that says the CSS file could not be found.Go ahead and open your favorite text editor or use your Python editor to create a file named `vertical.tcss`. Then enter the following code:Screen {
    layout: vertical;
}

Button {
    width: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
}You do not need the  portion of the CSS since that is technically taken care of automatically by Textual. Remember,  is the default widget when you launch an application. However, it is always good to be explicit so you understand what is happening. If you want the output to look exactly like the previous example, you can delete this CSS’s  portion and try running the code that way.If you decide to include the  portion of the CSS, you will make all of the  widgets 100% wide, which means they will all stretch across the entire width of the screen. The CSS also defines the button text to be yellow and the buttons themselves to have a read background color.When you run this code, you will see something like the following:That’s a fun way to change your vertically oriented widget layout. But what happens if you set the height of the  widgets to 50%? Well, you have three widgets. Three times 50 will be 150%, which is greater than what can be shown all at once. Textual will add a scrollbar if you add widgets that go off-screen.Try adding that setting to your CSS and re-run the code. You should see something like the following:You should spend a few moments trying out various width and height sizes. Remember, you don’t have to use percentages. You can also use Textual’s other unit types.: All style attributes can be adjusted at runtime, which means you can modify the layout at runtime, too. Use this wisely so as not to confuse the user!When you finish experimenting, you will be ready to learn how horizontal layouts work!Laying widgets out horizontally, left-to-right, requires a little more work than laying them out vertically. But the change is still pretty minor, and in many ways, it affects only one line in the CSS file.But before you change the CSS, you will want to update your Python code to point to the new CSS file. Open your Python editor and copy the previous example to a new file. Save it with the same  and update the  to point to a new CSS file named :# horizontal.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class HorizontalApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "horizontal.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = HorizontalApp()
    app.run()Yes, this code is almost the same as the previous example, except the  variable. That’s okay. The point is to show you how you can change the layout.Create your  file in a Python or text editor to make a horizontally oriented layout. Then enter the following CSS:Screen {
    layout: horizontal;
}

Button {
    height: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
    border: solid green;
}The CSS above added a border to the buttons to make them stand out a bit more. Depending on the terminal, the widgets appear to blend together more when arranged horizontally. You can add space around the widgets by setting the  style, though.When you run this code, you should see something like the following:When using a horizontal layout, the horizontal scrollbar will not automatically appear if the widgets do not fit the screen. If you want to have a horizontal scrollbar, then you will need to set , like in the following CSS:Screen {
    layout: horizontal;
    overflow-x: auto;
}

Button {
    height: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
    border: solid green;
}Now, set the widgets’ width to greater than 33% so that the scrollbar will appear. Spend some time experimenting, and you’ll soon figure it out!The Textual package has several utility containers you can use to lay out your widgets. You are most likely to use , , or  containers. You can also combine the containers to create more complex layouts.Here is a full list of the containers included with Textual at the time of writing:You will most likely use the , , , and  containers the most.Practicing is the best learning method, especially when laying out user interfaces. You can start your container journey by opening your Python editor and creating a new file called . Then enter the following code:# horizontal_container.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal


class HorizontalApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Horizontal(
            Button("OK"),
            Button("Cancel"),
            Button("Go!"),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = HorizontalApp()
    app.run()You import the  container from . The main contents of a container is its widgets. You reuse the widgets from the previous example here. Pay attention and note that you do not need to use  inside the container. You can simply add the widget instances instead.When you run this code, you will see something like this:What will happen if you use your  file with this code? Try adding it to the code above and re-run your example.The result will look familiar:The real benefit using containers comes when you nest them. You’ll find out about that concept next!Nesting containers allows you to combine horizontally and vertically oriented widgets, resulting in rows and columns of widgets. This design pattern can create some pretty nice layouts.To start, create a new file called  in your Python editor. Then add this code to it:# nested_containers.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical


class NestedApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Horizontal(
                Button("One"),
                Button("Two"),
                classes="row",
            ),
            Horizontal(
                Button("Three"),
                Button("Four"),
                classes="row",
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NestedApp()
    app.run()Your code above has a single  container with two  containers inside. You can think of the  containers as “rows”. You can see that you set the  parameters to “row” to identify them. Each row contains two  widgets.When you run this code, you will see something like this:This example doesn’t use any CSS. You should do that! Update the code to include a CSS file called , like the code below:# nested_containers.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical


class NestedApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "nested.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Horizontal(
                Button("One"),
                Button("Two"),
                classes="row",
            ),
            Horizontal(
                Button("Three"),
                Button("Four"),
                classes="row",
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NestedApp()
    app.run()Then, create the  file. You will be putting the following CSS rules into it:Button {
    content-align: center middle;
    background: green;
    border: yellow;
    height: 1fr;
    width: 1fr;
}Here, you set various rules for the  widgets to follow. You want the buttons to be green with a yellow border. You also set the width and height to , which causes the buttons to expand to fit all the horizontal and vertical space.When you run this version of your code, you can see that the user interface has changed significantly:Nice! You should spend some time adjusting the style rules and seeing how to change these layouts.Learning how to create layouts is a fundamental skill that you will need to master to be able to create engaging, intuitive user interfaces. Fortunately, Textual gives you enough tools that you can create your user interfaces fairly easily. No; you don’t get a What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) tool as you do with some GUI toolkits, such as QT Creator. But you do get live-coding with CSS, and since most of your user interface layouts are controlled there, tweaking the user interface is so nicer.Want to Learn More Textual?You will learn everything you need to know about Textual from this book.

Despite a fundamental difference in direction that led Anthropic's founders to quit OpenAI in 2020 and later create the Claude AI assistant, a shared technical hurdle has now brought them together: How to easily connect their AI models to external data sources.The solution comes from Anthropic, which developed and released an open specification called Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024. MCP establishes a royalty-free protocol that allows AI models to connect with outside data sources and services without requiring unique integrations for each service."Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications," wrote Anthropic in MCP's documentation. The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a debatable level of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sourcegraph and the Frontier of AI in Software Engineering with Beyang Liu</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/04/01/sourcegraph-and-the-frontier-of-ai-in-software-engineering-with-beyang-liu/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=sourcegraph-and-the-frontier-of-ai-in-software-engineering-with-beyang-liu</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2476129588.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Apr 2025 09:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sourcegraph is a powerful code search and intelligence tool that helps developers navigate and understand large codebases efficiently.

While AI undeniably impacts the way we write code, it hasn't fundamentally changed our role as engineers. Allow me to explain. 

[...] Vibe coding is interacting with the codebase via prompts. As the implementation is hidden from the "vibe coder", all the engineering concerns will inevitably get ignored. Many of the concerns are hard to express in a prompt, and many of them are hard to verify by only inspecting the final artifact. Historically, all engineering practices have tried to shift all those concerns left -- to the earlier stages of development when they're cheap to address. Yet with vibe coding, they're shifted very far to the right -- when addressing them is expensive. 

The question of whether an AI system can perform the complete engineering cycle and build and evolve software the same way a human can remains open. However, there are no signs of it being able to do so at this point, and if it one day happens, it won't have anything to do with vibe coding -- at least the way it's defined today. 

[...] It is possible that there'll be a future where software is built from vibe-coded blocks, but the work of designing software able to evolve and scale doesn't go away. That's not vibe engineering -- that's just engineering, even if the coding part of it will look a bit different.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open Source Genetic Database Shuts Down To Protect Users From &apos;Authoritarian Governments&apos;</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/03/31/1926246/open-source-genetic-database-shuts-down-to-protect-users-from-authoritarian-governments?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: The creator of an open source genetic database is shutting it down and deleting all of its data because he has come to believe that its existence is dangerous with "a rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments" in the United States and elsewhere. "The largest use case for DTC genetic data was not biomedical research or research in big pharma," Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, the founder of OpenSNP, wrote in a blog post. "Instead, the transformative impact of the data came to fruition among law enforcement agencies, who have put the genealogical properties of genetic data to use."
 
OpenSNP has collected roughly 7,500 genomes over the last 14 years, primarily by allowing people to voluntarily submit their own genetic information they have downloaded from 23andMe. With the bankruptcy of 23andMe, increased interest in genetic data by law enforcement, and the return of Donald Trump and rise of authoritarian governments worldwide, Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media he no longer believes it is ethical to run the database. "I've been thinking about it since 23andMe was on the verge of bankruptcy and been really considering it since the U.S. election. It definitely is really bad over there [in the United States]," Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media. "I am quite relieved to have made the decision and come to a conclusion. It's been weighing on my mind for a long time."
 
Greshake Tzovaras said that he is proud of the OpenSNP project, but that, in a world where scientific data is being censored and deleted and where the Trump administration has focused on criminalizing immigrants and trans people, he now believes that the most responsible thing to do is to delete the data and shut down the project. "Most people in OpenSNP may not be at particular risk right now, but there are people from vulnerable populations in here as well," Greshake Tzovaras said. "Thinking about gender representation, minorities, sexual orientation -- 23andMe has been working on the whole 'gay gene' thing, it's conceivable that this would at some point in the future become an issue." "Across the globe there is a rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments. While they are cracking down on free and open societies, they are also dedicated to replacing scientific thought and reasoning with pseudoscience across disciplines," Greshake Tzovaras wrote. "The risk/benefit calculus of providing free & open access to individual genetic data in 2025 is very different compared to 14 years ago. And so, sunsetting openSNP -- along with deleting the data stored within it -- feels like it is the most responsible act of stewardship for these data today."
 
"The interesting thing to me is there are data preservation efforts in the U.S. because the government is deleting scientific data that they don't like. This is approaching that same problem from a different direction," he added. "We need to protect the people in this database. I am supportive of preserving scientific data and knowledge, but the data comes second -- the people come first. We prefer deleting the data."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The idealization of farming by tech (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/138</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/138/changelog-news-138.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Theodore Morley wonders why tech workers so frequently point our wanderlust toward hands-on trades, Eduardo Bouças explains why he’s lost confidence in Vercel’s handling of Next.js, “xan” is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files directly from the shell, Pawel Brodzinski takes us back to Kanban’s roots &  Sergey Tselovalnikov weighs in on vibe coding.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

"I no longer think you should learn to code," Masad wrote on X. 

The statement comes as major tech executives report significant AI inroads into software development. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that 25% of new code at the tech giant is AI-generated, though still reviewed by engineers. Furthermore, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted AI could generate up to 90% of all code within six months. 

Masad called this shift a "bittersweet realization" after spending years popularizing coding through open-source work, Codecademy, and Replit -- a platform that now uses AI to help users build apps and websites. Instead of syntax-focused programming skills, Masad recommends learning "how to think, how to break down problems... how to communicate clearly, with humans and with machines."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This &quot;Fake&quot; Heart Saved a Life</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7cuOS7nmDY</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/f7cuOS7nmDY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:27:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Brilliant for free at https://brilliant.org/coldfusion - you'll also get 20% off an annual Premium subscription.

Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been called the most unqualified health secretary in the history of the US. Before his confirmation, over 22,000 doctors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject his appointment. During the confirmation hearing several senators grilled him on his concerning history related to vaccine misinformation: things like his founding of an anti-vax organization, his concerning anti-vax rhetoric, and his history of suing vaccine manufacturers, something he stands to make a lot of money doing. 

The former environmental lawyer was propelled to the nation’s highest health office largely by the “MAHA” movement, a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan (“Make America Healthy Again”). As health secretary, Kennedy wants to solve the chronic disease epidemic in the US, which plenty of doctors can get behind. The issue is that he aims to do it at the expense of infectious disease research. And therein lies the problem. Most people can agree when he says things like “I’m supportive of vaccines” and “I want good science.” The trouble is that his definition of “good” is, well — let’s call it historically shaky. In March, he appointed a well-known vaccine skeptic to head a study on the long-debunked potential link between vaccines and autism.

So what’s next? Can RFK Jr. take away vaccines that are already on the market? It’s unlikely, but he doesn’t need to. Kennedy sits at the helm of the very department he’s been undermining for years. In that position, the power he has over vaccine policy isn’t limitless, but the changes he can make could ripple for decades.

The new "hdrtest" code is for the Intel Xe kernel driver and is around trying to help ensure the Direct Rendering Manager header files are self-contained and pass kernel-doc tests — basic maintenance checks on the included DRM header files to ensure they are all in good shape. 

But Torvalds accused the code of not only slowing down the full-kernel builds, but also leaving behind "random" files for dependencies "that then make the source tree nasty," reports Tom's Hardware:

While Torvalds was disturbed by the code that was impacting the latest Linux kernel, beginning his post with a "Grr," he remained precise in his objections to it. "I did the pull, resolved the (trivial) conflicts, but I notice that this ended up containing the disgusting 'hdrtest' crap that (a) slows down the build because it's done for a regular allmodconfig build rather than be some simple thing that you guys can run as needed (b) also leaves random 'hdrtest' turds around in the include directories," he wrote. 

Torvalds went on to state that he had previously complained about this issue, and inquired why the hdr testing is being done as a regular part of the build. Moreover, he highlighted that the resulting 'turds' were breaking filename completion. Torvalds underlined this point — and his disgust — by stating, "this thing needs to *die*." In a shot of advice to fellow Linux developers, Torvalds said, "If you want to do that hdrtest thing, do it as part of your *own* checks. Don't make everybody else see that disgusting thing...." 
He then noted that he had decided to mark hdrtest as broken for now, to prevent its inclusion in regular builds.
 

As of Saturday, all of the DRM-Next code had made it into Linux 6.15 Git, notes Phoronix.

That's what TouchDevelop did for the long-discontinued Windows Phone in a 2013 Microsoft Research 'SmartSynth' natural language code generation demo. ("Write scripts by tapping on the screen.") 

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp reports on what happens when, 14 years later, you pose the same question to Copilot:

"You'll get lots of code and caveats from Copilot, but nothing that you can execute as is. (Compare that to the functioning 10 lines of code TouchDevelop program). It's a good reminder that just because GenAI can generate code, it doesn't necessarily mean it will generate the least amount of code, the most understandable or appropriate code for the requestor, or code that runs unchanged and produces the desired results. 
theodp also reminds us that TouchDevelop "was (like BASIC) abandoned by Microsoft..."


Interestingly, a Microsoft Research video from CS Education Week 2011 shows enthusiastic Washington high school students participating in an hour-long TouchDevelop coding lesson and demonstrating the apps they created that tapped into music, photos, the Internet, and yes, even their phone's functionality. This shows how lacking iPhone and Android still are today as far as easy programmability-for-the-masses goes. (When asked, Copilot replied that Apple's Shortcuts app wasn't up to the task).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Francis Drake (Part 1)</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/francis-drake-part-1</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67e5849d3e4472feec235228/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=EwQodpJfvzhhjUL-Ik0L_T9rcgkfBaoALzamcbJKzIE" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Douglas Murray: Putin, Zelenskyy, Trump, Israel, Netanyahu, Hamas &amp; Gaza | Lex Fridman Podcast #463</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvI42TyE5Ww</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HvI42TyE5Ww?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 20:12:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Douglas Murray is the author of On Democracies and Death Cults, The War on The West, and The Madness of Crowds.

While there's documentation and tutorials — there's no official language specification:

In December 2022, an RFC was submitted to encourage the Rust Project to begin working on a specification. After much discussion, the RFC was approved in July 2023, and work began. 

Initially, the Rust Project specification team (t-spec) were interested in creating the document from scratch using the Rust Reference as a guiding marker. However, the team knew there was already an external Rust specification that was being used successfully for compiler qualification purposes — the FLS. 

Thank Berlin-based Ferrous Systems, a Rust-based consultancy who assembled that description "some years ago," according to a post on the Rust blog:
 They've since been faithfully maintaining and updating this document for new versions of Rust, and they've successfully used it to qualify toolchains based on Rust for use in safety-critical industries. [The Rust Foundation notes it part of the consultancy's "Ferrocene" Rust compiler/toolchain.] Seeing this success, others have also begun to rely on the FLS for their own qualification efforts when building with Rust. 

The Rust Foundation explains:

The FLS provides a structured and detailed reference for Rust's syntax, semantics, and behavior, serving as a foundation for verification, compliance, and standardization efforts. Since Rust did not have an official language specification back then, nor a plan to write one, the FLS represented a major step toward describing Rust in a way that aligns with industry requirements, particularly in high-assurance domains. 

And the Rust Project is "passionate about shipping high quality tools that enable people to build reliable software at scale," adds the Rust blog. So...

It's in that light that we're pleased to announce that we'll be adopting the FLS into the Rust Project as part of our ongoing specification efforts. This adoption is being made possible by the gracious donation of the FLS by Ferrous Systems. We're grateful to them for the work they've done in assembling the FLS, in making it fit for qualification purposes, in promoting its use and the use of Rust generally in safety-critical industries, and now, for working with us to take the next step and to bring the FLS into the Project. 

With this adoption, we look forward to better integrating the FLS with the processes of the Project and to providing ongoing and increased assurances to all those who use Rust in safety-critical industries and, in particular, to those who use the FLS as part of their qualification efforts. 

More from the Rust Foundation:

The t-spec team wanted to avoid potential confusion from having two highly visible Rust specifications in the industry and so decided it would be worthwhile to try to integrate the FLS with the Rust Reference to create the official Rust Project specification. They approached Ferrous Systems, which agreed to contribute its FLS to the Rust Project and allow the Rust Project to take over its development and management... This generous donation will provide a clearer path to delivering an official Rust specification. It will also empower the Rust Project to oversee its ongoing evolution, providing confidence to companies and individuals already relying on the FLS, and marking a major milestone for the Rust ecosystem. 

"I really appreciate Ferrous taking this step to provide their specification to the Rust Project," said Joel Marcey, Director of Technology at the Rust Foundation and member of the t-spec team. "They have already done a massive amount of legwork...." This effort will provide others who require a Rust specification with an official, authoritative reference for their work with the Rust programming language... This is an exciting outcome. A heartfelt thank you to the Ferrous Systems team for their invaluable contribution! 

Marcey said the move allows the team "to supercharge our progress in the delivery of an official Rust specification." 

And the co-founder of Ferrous Systems, Felix Gilcher, also sounded excited. "We originally created the Ferrocene Language Specification to provide a structured and reliable description of Rust for the certification of the Ferrocene compiler. As an open source-first company, contributing the FLS to the Rust Project is a logical step toward fostering the development of a unified, community-driven specification that benefits all Rust users."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Before Pangea: The Supercontinents</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cU9i-JGgPQ</link><author>SEA</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6cU9i-JGgPQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9ShGbASoiwHwFcLcAh9EA">SEA</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long ago, the Earth's seven continents were assembled in a giant, sprawling supercontinent known as Pangea. You may've heard of it, but what is often less talked about is what came before Pangea. Our planet's current continental chunks have been smashing together and separating for over four billion years, and there have been more than a few "supercontinents" during that time. Those lost lands take the stage in this video, as we wind the clock back to the age of the supercontinents before Pangea.

This one has been in the pipeline for many months. It is slightly different to the usual astronomy content but I hope you will all enjoy it just the same.

He explores AI’s role in job interviews, personalized AI assistants, and the evolving nature of human-computer interaction. Key topics include AI-driven self-analysis, context-aware AI systems, and the impact of AI on optimizing human decision-making. The conversation highlights how AI can enhance creativity, collaboration, and efficiency by reducing cognitive load and making intelligent suggestions in real time.Fausto Albers is a relentless explorer of the unconventional—a techno-optimist with a foundation in sociology and behavioral economics, always connecting seemingly absurd ideas that, upon closer inspection, turn out to be the missing pieces of a bigger puzzle. He thrives in paradox: he overcomplicates the simple, oversimplifies the complex, and yet somehow lands on solutions that feel inevitable in hindsight. He believes that true innovation exists in the tension between chaos and structure—too much of either, and you’re stuck.His career has been anything but linear. He’s owned and operated successful restaurants, served high-stakes cocktails while juggling bottles on London’s bar tops, and later traded spirits for code—designing digital waiters, recommender systems, and AI-driven accounting tools. Now, he leads the AI Builders Club Amsterdam, a fast-growing community where AI engineers, researchers, and founders push the boundaries of intelligent systems.Ask him about RAG, and he’ll insist on specificity—because, as he puts it, discussing retrieval-augmented generation without clear definitions is as useful as declaring that “AI will have an impact on the world.” An engaging communicator, a sharp systems thinker, and a builder of both technology and communities, Fausto is here to challenge perspectives, deconstruct assumptions, and remix the future of AI.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExploreJoin our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkmConnect with Fausto on LinkedIn: /stepintoliquid]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Announces &apos;Hyperlight Wasm&apos;: Speedy VM-Based Security at Scale with a WebAssembly Runtime</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/30/0627205/microsoft-announces-hyperlight-wasm-speedy-vm-based-security-at-scale-with-a-webassembly-runtime?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cloud providers like the security of running things in virtual machines "at scale" — even though VMs "are not known for having fast cold starts or a small footprint..." noted Microsoft's Open Source blog last November. So Microsoft's Azure Core Upstream team built an open source Rust library called Hyperlight "to execute functions as fast as possible while isolating those functions within a VM." 

But that was just the beginning...

 Then, we showed how to run Rust functions really, really fast, followed by using C to [securely] run Javascript. In February 2025, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) voted to onboard Hyperlight into their Sandbox program [for early-stage projects]. 

[This week] we're announcing the release of Hyperlight Wasm: a Hyperlight virtual machine "micro-guest" that can run wasm component workloads written in many programming languages... 

Traditional virtual machines do a lot of work to be able to run programs. Not only do they have to load an entire operating system, they also boot up the virtual devices that the operating system depends on. Hyperlight is fast because it doesn't do that work; all it exposes to its VM guests is a linear slice of memory and a CPU. No virtual devices. No operating system. But this speed comes at the cost of compatibility. Chances are that your current production application expects a Linux operating system running on the x86-64 architecture (hardware), not a bare linear slice of memory... 

[B]uilding Hyperlight with a WebAssembly runtime — wasmtime — enables any programming language to execute in a protected Hyperlight micro-VM without any prior knowledge of Hyperlight at all. As far as program authors are concerned, they're just compiling for the wasm32-wasip2 target... Executing workloads in the Hyperlight Wasm guest isn't just possible for compiled languages like C, Go, and Rust, but also for interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#. The trick here, much like with containers, is to also include a language runtime as part of the image... Programming languages, runtimes, application platforms, and cloud providers are all starting to offer rich experiences for WebAssembly out of the box. If we do things right, you will never need to think about whether your application is running inside of a Hyperlight Micro-VM in Azure. You may never know your workload is executing in a Hyperlight Micro VM. And that's a good thing. 

While a traditional virtual-device-based VM takes about 125 milliseconds to load, "When the Hyperlight VMM creates a new VM, all it needs do to is create a new slice of memory and load the VM guest, which in turn loads the wasm workload. This takes about 1-2 milliseconds today, and work is happening to bring that number to be less than 1 millisecond in the future." 

And there's also double security due to Wasmtime's software-defined runtime sandbox within Hyperlight's larger VM...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline: The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air - The Complete History Of The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69j2gg_OICw</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/69j2gg_OICw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today on Weird History we are taking a deep look into 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'!

And over the past 8 years as a Software Engineer, I’ve seen them used repeatedly when building and scaling large systems.I’ve also included links to detailed articles I’ve written on several of these topics, so you can dive deeper whenever you’d like.I also recently created a  that quickly walks through all 30 concepts—packed with visuals and animations to make everything easier to understand.Subscribe for more such videos!1. Client-Server ArchitectureAlmost every web application that you use is built on this simple yet powerful concept called client-server architecture.On one side, you have a —this could be a web browser, a mobile app, or any other frontend application.and on the other side, you have a —a machine that runs continuously, waiting to handle incoming requests.The client sends a request to store, retrieve, or modify data.The server receives the request, processes it, performs the necessary operations, and sends back a response.This sounds simple, but there’s a big question: How does the client even know where to find the server?A client doesn’t magically know where a server is, it needs an  to locate and communicate with it.On the internet, computers identify each other using , which work like phone numbers for servers.Every publicly deployed server has a . When a client wants to interact with a service, it must send requests to the correct IP address.When we visit a website, we don’t type its IP address—we just enter the website name.We can’t expect users (or even systems) to memorize a string of random numbers for every service they connect to.And if we migrate our service to another server, its IP address may change—breaking all direct connections.Instead of relying on hard-to-remember IP addresses, we use something much more human-friendly: .But, we need a way to map a domain name to it’s corresponding IP address.This is where DNS (or Domain Name System) comes in. It maps easy to remember domain names (like algomaster.io) to their corresponding IP addresses.Here’s what happens behind the scenes:When you type  into your browser, your computer asks a DNS server for the corresponding IP address.Once the DNS server responds with the IP, your browser uses it to establish a connection with the server and make a request.You can find the IP address of any domain using the  command. Just open your terminal and type ping followed by the domain name. And it’ll return the IP address currently assigned to that domain.When you visit a website, your request doesn’t always go directly to the server—sometimes, it passes through a  or  first.A  acts as a  between your device and the internet.When you request a webpage, the proxy forwards your request to the target server, retrieves the response, and sends it back to you.Proxy hides your IP address, keeping your location and identity private.A  works the other way around. It intercepts client requests and forwards them to backend servers based on predefined rules.Allowing direct access to servers can pose , exposing them to threats like  and .A reverse proxy mitigates these risks by acting as a controlled entry point that regulates incoming traffic and hides server IPs.It can also act as a load balancer, distributing traffic across multiple servers.If you want to learn about Proxy vs Reverse Proxy in more detail, checkout this article:Whenever a client communicates with a server, there’s always some delay. One of the biggest causes of this delay is .For example, if our server is in , but a user in  sends a request, the data has to travel halfway across the world—and then the response has to make the same long trip back.This round-trip delay is called —the total time it takes for data to travel between the client and the server. High latency can make applications feel slow and unresponsive.One way to  is by deploying our service across multiple data centers worldwide.This way, users can connect to the  server instead of waiting for data to travel across the globe.Once a connection is made, how do clients and servers actually communicate?Every time you visit a website, your browser and the server communicate using a set of rules called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).That’s why most URLs start with  or its secure version, .The  sends a request to the server. This request includes a  (containing details like the request type, browser type, and cookies) and sometimes a  (which carries additional data, like form inputs).The  processes the request and responds with an —either returning the requested data or an error message if something goes wrong.HTTP has a major security flaw, it . This is a serious problem, especially for sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal data.That’s why modern websites use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead. HTTPS encrypts all data using  ensuring that even if someone intercepts the request, they can’t read or alter it.But clients and servers don’t directly exchange raw HTTP requests and response.HTTP is just a  for transferring data but it doesn’t define:How requests should be structuredWhat format responses should be inor how different clients should interact with the server.This is where APIs (or Application Programming Interfaces) come in.Think of an API as a  that allows clients (like web and mobile apps) to communicate with servers without worrying about low-level details.Almost every digital service you use—social media, e-commerce, online banking, ride-hailing apps—is built on APIs working together behind the scenes.Here’s how it typically works:A  sends a request to an API.The , hosted on a server, processes the request, interacts with databases or other services, and prepares a response.The API sends back the response in a structured format, usually  or , which the client understands and can display.APIs provide a —the client doesn’t need to know  the server processes the request, only that it returns the expected data.If you want to learn more about APIs, checkout this article:But, not all APIs are built the same. Different API styles exist to serve different needs. Two of the most popular ones are  and .Among the different API styles, REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most widely used.A  follows a set of rules that define how clients and servers communicate over HTTP in a structured way. Every request is independent; the server doesn’t store client state. Everything is treated as a resource (e.g., /users, /orders, /products).Uses Standard HTTP Methods: Clients interact with resources using  like: → Retrieves data (e.g., fetching a user profile). → Creates new data (e.g., adding a new user). → Updates existing data (e.g., changing user settings). → Removes data (e.g., deleting an account).REST APIs are great because they’re simple, scalable, and easy to cache, but they have , especially when dealing with complex data retrieval.REST endpoints often return , leading to inefficient network usage. If an API doesn’t return related data, the client may need to  to retrieve all required information.To address these challenges, GraphQL was introduced in 2015 by Facebook.Unlike REST, which forces clients to retrieve ,  lets clients ask for exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less.With a REST API, if you need a user details, user profile details along with their recent posts, you might have to  to different endpoints: → fetch user detailsGET /api/users/123/profile → fetch user profile → fetch user’s postsWith GraphQL, you can combine those requests into one and fetch exactly the data you need in a single query:The server responds with only the requested fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer and improving efficiency.However, GraphQL also comes with trade-offs—it requires more processing on the server side and isn’t as easy to cache as REST.Learn more about REST vs GraphQL here:When a client makes a request, they usually want to .But this brings up another question—where is the actual data stored?If our application deals with , we could store it .But modern applications handle —far more than what memory can efficiently handle.That’s why we need a dedicated server for storing and managing data—a .A database is the backbone of any application.It ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently while keeping it secure, consistent, and durable.When a client requests to  or  data, the server communicates with the database, fetches the required information, and returns it to the client.But not all databases are the same. Different applications have different scalability, performance, and consistency requirements, which is choosing the right type of database is important.If you want to learn about different types of databases, checkout this article:In system design, we typically choose between .SQL databases store data in tables with a  and follow the . - A transaction is  (it either completes fully or not at all). – Data always remains  and follows defined rules. – Transactions  with each other. – Once data is saved, it , even if the system crashes.Because of these guarantees, SQL databases are ideal for applications that require strong consistency and structured relationships, such as .Examples of popular SQL databases include: MySQL and PostgreSQLNoSQL databases on the other hand are designed for high scalability and performance.They don’t require a fixed schema and use different data models, including: – Fast lookups for simple key-value pairs (e.g., Redis). – Store flexible, JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB). – Best for highly connected data (e.g., Neo4j). – Optimized for large-scale, distributed data (e.g., Cassandra).So, which one should you use? It depends on the system requirements.If you need structured, relational data with strong consistency → If you need high scalability, flexible schemas, or fast reads/writes at scale → NoSQL is a better choice.Many modern applications use both SQL and NoSQL together.For example, an e-commerce platform might:Store customer orders in SQL (because they require strict consistency).and store Product recommendations in NoSQL (because they need flexible and fast lookups).If you want to learn more about SQL vs NoSQL, checkout this article:As our , so does the number of requests hitting our application servers.Initially, a  might be enough to handle the load. But, as traffic increases, that single server can become a bottleneck, slowing everything down.One of the quickest solutions is to upgrade the existing server by adding more CPU, RAM or storage.This approach is called Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)—making a single machine more powerful.But there are some major limitations with this approach: You can’t keep upgrading a server forever. Every machine has a maximum capacity. More powerful servers become exponentially more expensive.Single Point of Failure (SPOF) if this one server crashes, the entire system .So, while vertical scaling is a quick fix, it’s not a long-term solution for handling high traffic and ensuring system reliability.Lets look at a better approach—one that makes our system more scalable and fault tolerant.Instead of upgrading a single server, what if we  to share the load?This approach is called Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)—where we distribute the workload across multiple machines.This approach is better because:More servers = More capacity → The system can handle increasing traffic more effectively.No Single Point of Failure → If one server goes down, others can , improving reliability.Instead of investing in a single, super-expensive machine, we can use multiple affordable ones.But horizontal scaling introduces a new challenge: how do clients know which server to connect to?This is where a  comes in.A  sits between  and , acting as a  that distributes requests across multiple servers.If one server crashes, the Load Balancer automatically redirects traffic to another healthy server.But how does a Load Balancer decide which server should handle the next request?It uses Load Balancing algorithms, such as: Requests are sent to servers sequentially, one after another in a loop. Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections. Requests from the same IP address always go to the , which helps with Learn more about load balancing algorithms here:So far, we’ve talked about scaling our application servers, but as traffic grows, the volume of data also increases.At first, we can scale a database  by adding more CPU, RAM, and storage, but there’s a limit to how much a single machine can handle.So, let’s explore other database scaling techniques that help manage large volumes of data efficiently.One of the quickest and most effective ways to speed up database  is .Think of it like the index page at the back of a book—instead of flipping through every page, you jump directly to the relevant section.A  works the same way. It’s is a super-efficient lookup table that helps the database quickly locate the required data without scanning the entire table.An index stores column values along with pointers to the actual data rows in the table.Indexes are typically created on columns that are frequently queried, such as:Columns used in WHERE conditionsBut be careful—while indexes speed up reads, they slow down writes (, , ) since the index needs to be updated whenever data changes.That’s why we should only index the most frequently accessed columns.Learn more about Database Indexes here:Indexing significantly improves , but what if even indexing isn’t enough, and our database can’t handle the growing number of read requests?That’s where our next database scaling technique  comes in.Just like we added more application servers to handle traffic, we can scale our database by creating of it across multiple servers.We have  (also called the ) that handles all  (, , ).We have  that handle .Whenever data is written to the primary database, it gets copied to the read replicas so that they stay in sync.Replication improves the read performance since read requests are spread across multiple replicas, reducing the load on each one.This also improves availability since if the primary replica fails, a read replica can take over as the new primary.Replication is great for scaling read heavy applications, but what if we need to scale writes or store huge amounts of data?Let’s say our service now has and our database has grown to.A  will eventually struggle to handle all this data efficiently.Instead of keeping everything in one place, we split the database into smaller, more manageable pieces and distribute them across .This technique is called .We divide the database into smaller parts called .Each  of the total data.Data is distributed based on a  (e.g., ).By distributing data this way, we: → Each shard handles  of queries.Speed up read and write performance → Queries are distributed across multiple shards instead of hitting a single database.Sharding is also referred to as horizontal partitioning since it splits data by rows.If you want to learn more about Sharding, checkout this article:But what if the issue isn’t the number of rows, but rather the number of columns?In such cases, we use , where we split the database by columns. Let’s explore that next.18. Vertical PartitioningImagine we have a  that stores:profile details (name, email, profile picture)login history (last_login, IP addresses)and billing information (billing address, payment details)As this table , queries become  because the database must scan  even when a request only needs a To optimize this, we use Vertical Partitioning where we split user table into smaller, more focused tables based on usage patterns. → Stores name, email, profile picture. → Stores login timestamps. → Stores billing address, payment details.This improves  since each request only scans  instead of the entire .It reduces , making data retrieval quicker.However, no matter how much we optimize the database, retrieving data from disk is always slower than retrieving from memory.What if we could store frequently accessed data in memory for lightning-fast access? is used to optimize the performance of a system by storing frequently accessed data in memory instead of repeatedly fetching it from the database.One of the most common caching strategies is the When a user , the application first check the .If the data is , it’s returned instantly, avoiding a database call.If the data , the application retrieves it from the database, stores it in the cache for future requests, and returns it to the user.Next time, the same data is requested, it’s served , making the request much faster.To prevent outdated data from being served, we use —an expiration time set on cached data so it gets  after a certain period.Popular caching tools include If you want to learn more about caching strategies, check out this article:Lets look at the next database scaling technique.Most relational databases use  to store data efficiently by breaking it into separate tables.For example, in an e-commerce system:The  stores user details.The  stores their orders.The  stores product details.While this , it also When retrieving data from multiple tables, the database must combine them using JOIN operations, which can slow down queries as the dataset grows.SELECT o.order_id, u.name, u.email, o.product, o.amount
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.user_id; reduces the number of joins by combining related data into a single table, even if it means some data gets duplicated. Instead of keeping and in separate tables, we create  table that stores user details along with their latest orders.Now, when retrieving a user’s order history, we don’t need a —the data is already stored together leading to faster queries and better read performance.SELECT order_id, user_name AS name, user_email AS email, product, amount
FROM orders;Denormalization is often used in read-heavy applications where speed is more critical but the downside is it leads to  and more .As we scale our system across multiple servers, databases, and data centers, we enter the world of .One of the fundamental principles of distributed systems is the , which states that: No distributed system can achieve all three of the following at the same time: Every node always returns the . The system  to requests, even if some nodes are down (but the data may not be the latest). The system continues operating even if there’s a  between nodes.Since network failures (P) are inevitable, we must choose between:Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP) → Ensures every request gets the latest data but may reject requests during failures. Example: .Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP) → Ensures the system always responds, even if some data is stale. Example: NoSQL databases like Cassandra and DynamoDB.To learn more about CAP theorem, check out this article:In distributed NoSQL databases, achieving  across all servers .Instead, we use —which means:Not all nodes are updated instantly, but given enough time, they  sync and return the same data.This allows the system to remain highly available and fast, even under extreme loads.How Eventual Consistency Works:A user updates data in  of the database.The system  acknowledges the update, ensuring .The update is then propagated asynchronously to other replicas.After a short delay, all replicas have the latest data, ensuring .Most modern applications don’t just store text records, they also need to handle , ,  and other .But here’s the problem: Traditional databases are not designed to store large, unstructured files efficiently.We use Blob Storage like Amazon S3—a highly scalable and cost-effective way to store large, unstructured files in the cloud.Blobs are the individual files like images, videos or documents.These blobs are stored inside logical containers or buckets in the cloud.Each file gets a , making it easy to retrieve and serve over the web. https://my-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/tutorial.mp4There are several advantages with using blob storage like: → It can store petabytes of data effortlessly. → You only pay for storage and retrieval that you actually use. → Data is copied across multiple data centers and availability zones for durability. → Files can be retrieved using REST APIs or direct URLs.A common use case is to stream audio or video files to user application in real-time.But streaming directly from blob-storage can be slow, especially if the data is stored in a .For example, imagine you’re in  trying to watch a YouTube video that’s hosted on a server in .Since the video data has to , this could lead to buffering and slow load times.A Content Delivery Network (or CDN) solves this problem by delivering content faster to users based on their location.A CDN is a global network of distributed servers that work together to deliver  (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their .Instead of serving content from a , a CDN  on multiple edge servers located worldwide.When a user requests content, the  delivers it instead of reaching all the way to the .Since content is served from the , users experience  with minimal buffering.To learn more about CDN, check out this article:Most web applications use , which follows a  model.The client sends a request.The

dashboards and online multiplayer games.With HTTP, the only way to get real-time updates is through —sending repeated requests every few seconds.But polling is inefficient because it increases server load and wastes bandwidth, as  (when there’s no new data).WebSockets solve this problem by allowing continuous, two-way communication between the  over a single persistent connection.Here is how WebSockets work:The client initiates a WebSocket connection with the server.Once established, the connection .The server can push updates to the client , without waiting for a request.The client can also send messages This enables real-time interactions and eliminates the need for polling.To learn more about WebSockets, check out this article:WebSockets enable real-time communication between a client and a server, but what if a server needs to notify another server when an event occurs?When a user makes a payment, Stripe needs to notify your application .If someone pushes code to GitHub, a CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins) should be triggered automatically.Instead of constantly  to check if an event has occured,  allow a server to  to another server as soon as the event occurs.The  registers a webhook URL with the provider (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Twilio).When an event occurs (e.g., user makes a payment), the provider sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL with event details.Your app processes the incoming request and updates data accordingly.This saves server resources and reduces unnecessary API calls.Traditionally, applications were built using a , where:All features (e.g., authentication, payments, orders, shipping) are inside .If one part of the system , the  is affected.—one bad update can take down the entire app. Imagine an e-commerce app where the , , and modules

checkout service) places a message in the queue (e.g., "Process Payment").The queue temporarily holds the message until a  (e.g., payment service) is ready to process it.The consumer retrieves the

But, how do we prevent overload for the public APIs and services we deploy.Imagine a bot starts making thousands of requests per second to your website.Without restrictions, this could: by consuming all available resources. due to excessive API usage.and  for legitimate users.Rate Limiting restricts the number of requests a client can send within a specific time frame.Every user or IP address is assigned a  (e.g., ).If they , the server blocks additional requests temporarily and returns an error (HTTP 429 – Too Many Requests).There are various rate limiting algorithms.

Three security bypasses have been discovered in Ubuntu Linux's unprivileged user namespace restrictions, which could be enable a local attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in kernel components. The issues allow local unprivileged users to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities and impact Ubuntu versions 23.10, where unprivileged user namespaces restrictions are enabled, and 24.04 which has them active by default... 

Ubuntu added AppArmor-based restrictions in version 23.10 and enabled them by default in 24.04 to limit the risk of namespace misuse. Researchers at cloud security and compliance company Qualys found that these restrictions can be bypassed in three different ways... The researchers note that these bypasses are dangerous when combined with kernel-related vulnerabilities, and they are not enough to obtain complete control of the system... Qualys notified the Ubuntu security team of their findings on January 15 and agreed to a coordinated release. However, the busybox bypass was discovered independently by vulnerability researcher Roddux, who published the details on March 21. 


Canonical, the organization behind Ubuntu Linux, has acknowledged Qualys' findings and confirmed to BleepingComputer that they are developing improvements to the AppArmor protections. A spokesperson told us that they are not treating these findings as vulnerabilities per se but as limitations of a defense-in-depth mechanism. Hence, protections will be released according to standard release schedules and not as urgent security fixes.

--

Of all Shakespeare’s plays, perhaps none is stranger than “Macbeth”— a parable on power rife with supernatural elements. But according to texts from the 11th century, this tragedy has its roots in reality. What’s more, other accounts mention witches, prophecies, and arboreal armies. Which raises the question: just how much of Shakespeare’s strange story is true? Benjamin Hudson investigates.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.January 2023 - London, United Kingdom.A student named Kenji is on a tourist visit.Yet he spends so much time waiting in queue to buy tickets for the underground train.He hears about the tap & pay service called Apple Pay from the station officer.Although doubtful about its safety, he decides to try it.Transitioning to microservices is tough. It’s not just a technical shift, but an organizational one too.From defining service boundaries to managing decentralized data and handling interservice communication, many things can go wrong.This 80+ page ebook breaks down common migration challenges with examples from dev teams at Uber, Spotify & Netflix, helping you understand the obstacles before you hit them.Here’s a simplified version of Apple Pay architecture:Chapter 1: A Credit Card, a Wallet, and an iPhoneKenji enters his credit card details into the Apple Wallet.Yet Apple doesn’t store it on the iPhone or Apple servers.Instead they send credit card details and iPhone metadata to the payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, in encrypted form.The iPhone metadata includes its model number and secure element ID. Imagine the  as a unique number assigned to each iPhone.The payment network verifies the credit card details and generates a device account number (). Think of DAN as a unique random number representing the credit card number, but irreversible.Also the to each credit card and iPhone.The payment network sends DAN to the iPhone in encrypted form. And the iPhone stores it inside the , a highly specialized chip, so nobody can access it. Besides Apple servers don’t store DAN for security and privacy.While the payment network keeps a copy of the DAN, credit card details, and iPhone metadata.Chapter 2: A Single Tap to Open the GateKenji has no internet connection due to roaming.Yet he taps his iPhone on the card reader at the train station gate.The iPhone communicates with the card reader via near-field communication (). Consider NFC as a short-range, wireless communication standard.The card reader creates a transaction record, which contains details such as the payment amount and date.The card reader then sends these details to the iPhone via NFC.Yet Apple Pay must validate the transaction by checking Kenji’s involvement in it. So they ask for his biometric information, such as a touch ID or face ID. They don’t store the biometric information on Apple servers, but only on the secure enclave in the iPhone. Imagine the  as a separate processor inside the iPhone, isolated from the rest of the system.The secure enclave fetches the encrypted biometric information when Kenji places his finger on the touch ID. It confirms his identity by comparing the data with the stored biometric information.This approach ensures biometric information never leaves the iPhone.Chapter 3: No Credit Card, No Cash, No ProblemThe secure enclave confirms Kenji’s identity and signals the secure element.Think of the  as a highly specialized chip in the iPhone. It combines DAN and transaction details to create a unique cryptogram. This is called the .Imagine the  as a time-based, single-use password to prove a transaction’s legitimacy.The iPhone sends an authorization request to the payment network. It contains the request cryptogram and transaction details. Put simply, DAN never leaves the iPhone for security.The payment network regenerates the request cryptogram by combining the transaction details and DAN copy. A payment is valid only if the cryptogram values are equal.Chapter 4: The Problem With Contactless PaymentYet the train station keeps Kenji's gate closed until his payment gets confirmed.So the payment network creates a response code, a number representing the payment status. Then combines it with the DAN and the request cryptogram to create a new cryptogram. This is called the .The payment network sends a response to the card reader. It includes only the response code and response cryptogram. Put simply, doesn’t send DAN and request cryptogram.The iPhone regenerates the response cryptogram using the request cryptogram, DAN, and response code. The card reader considers a payment network authentic only if cryptogram values are equal. While the response code represents the payment status.A credit card displays sensitive information, so there’s a risk of information misuse. But Apple Pay is safer as it doesn’t show credit card information to anyone.Apple Pay relies on the EMV contactless payment specification as part of its security model. Think of  as a chip-based card payment authentication mechanism.While Kenji visited the main tourist sights in London and happily returned home.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in a few months.Yet it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

But over the years, Kafka has evolved far beyond that initial use case.Today, Kafka is a powerful, distributed event streaming platform used by companies across every industry—from tech giants like Netflix and Uber to banks, retailers, and IoT platforms.Its core architecture, based on immutable append-only logs, , and , makes it incredibly scalable, fault-tolerant, and versatile.In this article, we’ll explore the 10 powerful use cases of Kafka with real-world examples.In modern distributed applications, logs and metrics are generated across hundreds or even thousands of servers, containers, and applications. These logs need to be collected for monitoring, debugging, and security auditing.Traditionally, logs were stored locally on servers, making it difficult to search, correlate, and analyze system-wide events.Kafka solves this by acting as a , enabling fault-tolerant, scalable, and high-throughput pipeline for log collection processing.Instead of sending logs directly to a storage system, applications and logging agents stream log events to Kafka topics. Kafka provides a durable buffer that absorbs spikes in log volumes while decoupling producers and consumers.Kafka Log Aggregation PipelineStep 1: Applications Send Logs to Kafka (Producers)Each microservice, web server, or application container generates logs in real time and sends them to Kafka via lightweight log forwarders (log agents) like: Fluentd, Logstash or Filebeat.These tools publish logs to specific Kafka topics (e.g., , ).Step 2: Kafka Brokers Store LogsKafka acts as the central, durable and distributed log store, providing: - logs are replicated across multiple brokers  - logs are stored on disk for configurable retention periods Kafka can handle logs from thousands of sourcesStep 3: Consumers Process LogsLog consumers (like Elasticsearch, Hadoop, or cloud storage systems) read data from Kafka and process it for:for searching and filtering logslong-term archiving in S3, HDFS, or object storagetrigger alerts based on log patternsStep 4: Visualization and AlertingProcessed logs are visualized and monitored using tools like:  - for dashboards and visualization - for real-time alerting  - for advanced log analysis and security insightsChange Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to track changes in a database (inserts, updates, deletes) and stream those changes in real time to downstream systems.Modern architectures rely on multiple systems—search engines, caches, data lakes, microservices—all of which need . Traditional  are slow, introduce latency, and often lead to: in search indexes and analytics dashboards when syncing multiple systems due to frequent pollingKafka provides a high-throughput, real-time event pipeline that captures and distributes changes from a source database to multiple consumers—ensuring low latency and consistency across systems.Step 1: Capture Changes from the DatabaseTools like , , or  read the database transaction logs (binlogs, WALs) to detect: INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEsEach change is transformed into a structured event and published to a Kafka topic.Step 2: Stream Events via KafkaKafka topics act as an , providing: — All changes are stored reliably — Events for a given key (e.g., primary key) are strictly ordered — Thousands of events per second per partitionStep 3: Distribute to Real-Time ConsumersMultiple consumers can subscribe to the change events for various use cases: → Sync changes to Elasticsearch / OpenSearch → Update  for fast reads → Stream into BigQuery / Snowflake / Redshift]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Kernel 6.14 Is a Big Leap Forward In Performance, Windows Compatibility</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/26/2110211/linux-kernel-614-is-a-big-leap-forward-in-performance-windows-compatibility?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet, written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols: Despite the minor delay, Linux 6.14 arrives packed with cutting-edge features and improvements to power upcoming Linux distributions, such as the forthcoming Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42. The big news for desktop users is the improved NTSYNC driver, especially those who like to play Windows games or run Windows programs on Linux. This driver is designed to emulate Windows NT synchronization primitives. What that feature means for you and me is that it will significantly improve the performance of Windows programs running on Wine and Steam Play. [...] Gamers always want the best possible graphics performance, so they'll also be happy to see that Linux now supports recently launched AMD RDNA 4 graphics cards. This approach includes support for the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. Combine this support with the recently improved open-source RADV driver and AMD gamers should see the best speed yet on their gaming rigs.
 
Of course, the release is not just for gamers. Linux 6.14 also includes several AMD and Intel processor enhancements. These boosts focus on power management, thermal control, and compute performance optimizations. These updates are expected to improve overall system efficiency and performance. This release also comes with the AMDXDNA driver, which provides official support for AMD's neural processing units based on the XDNA architecture. This integration enables efficient execution of AI workloads, such as convolutional neural networks and large language models, directly on supported AMD hardware. While Rust has faced some difficulties in recent months in Linux, more Rust programming language abstractions have been integrated into the kernel, laying the groundwork for future drivers written in Rust. [...] Besides drivers, Miguel Ojeda, Rust for Linux's lead developer, said recently that the introduction of the macro for smart pointers with Rust 1.84: derive(CoercePointee) is an "important milestone on the way to building a kernel that only uses stable Rust functions." This approach will also make integrating C and Rust code easier. We're getting much closer to Rust being grafted into Linux's tree.
 
In addition, Linux 6.14 supports Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor, enhancing performance and stability for devices powered by this chipset. That support means you can expect to see much faster Android-based smartphones later this year. This release includes a patch for the so-called GhostWrite vulnerability, which can be used to root some RISC-V processors. This fix will block such attacks. Additionally, Linux 6.14 includes improvements for the copy-on-write Btrfs file system/logical volume manager. These primarily read-balancing methods offer flexibility for different RAID hardware configurations and workloads. Additionally, support for uncached buffered I/O optimizes memory usage on systems with fast storage devices. Linux 6.14 is available for download here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What a crab sees before a cuttlefish eats it</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nhFyf-vPus</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_nhFyf-vPus?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 20:05:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scientists have a new theory about the unique form of camouflage in cuttlefish.

Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date.The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation processThe Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation.Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable, or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the deprecation guide.Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.33Deprecation of the stable Endpoints APIThe EndpointSlices API has been stable since v1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans in the coming weeks.Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the release announcement, the status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field will be removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, the v1.33 release will remove this field entirely.Removal of host network support for Windows podsWindows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node’s networking namespace.
The original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but as it faced unexpected containerd behaviours,
and alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated
KEP. We're expecting to see support fully removed in v1.33.Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33As authors of this article, we picked one improvement as the most significant change to call out!Support for user namespaces within Linux PodsOne of the oldest open KEPs today is KEP-127, Pod security improvement by using Linux User namespaces for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify  to opt in. As highlighted in the v1.30 sneak peek blog, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvementsThe following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of PodsWhen provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod’s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's  were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?The KEP-1287 is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33.DRA’s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to betaThe  field in ResourceClaim , originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities.For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status document.Ordered namespace deletionThis KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes’s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions.Enhancements for indexed job managementThese two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. KEP-3850 provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes. Also, KEP-3998 extends Job API to define conditions for making an indexed job as successfully completed when not all indexes are succeeded.New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.33 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.Kubernetes v1.33 release is planned for Wednesday, 23rd April, 2025.

FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as the Terrorgram Collective grew and operated and what its rise and fall tell us about the evolution of far-right extremism on loosely-moderated tech platforms.

“The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram” traces how various loosely-moderated platforms, from 4chan to 8chan to eventually Telegram, have become havens for extremist ideas and for radicalization. The investigation shows how a number of attackers around the world — from Slovakia to New Zealand to the United States — used these various platforms and were encouraged by them.

“Drawing on a trove of archived posts, our reporting shows how Telegram and other lightly regulated platforms became a gathering place for ‘militant accelerationists’ — neo-Nazis who want to use terror and violence to bring down governments and create new, white ethnostates,” says A.C. Thompson, who has been reporting on the evolution of violent extremism in the U.S. for years.

The film also probes how authorities in several countries would eventually arrest around a dozen people allegedly tied to the Terrorgram Collective, a transnational virtual network of extremists accused of inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism. The U.S. government would charge two Americans with a slew of felonies, including soliciting the murder of government officials on Telegram. Telegram says it has always screened postings for problematic content and that, “Calls for violence from any group are not tolerated on our platform.”

“The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram” is a FRONTLINE production with 2over10 Media in association with ProPublica. The directors are Thomas Jennings and Annie Wong. The producers are Annie Wong, Thomas Jennings and A.C. Thompson. The writers are Thomas Jennings and A.C. Thompson. The co-producers are Karina Meier and Fanny Lee. The correspondents are A.C.

      Robert Griesemer
      26 March 2025
      The Go 1.18 release introduced generics and with that a number of new features, including type parameters, type constraints, and new concepts such as type sets.
It also introduced the notion of a .
While the former provide concrete new functionality, a core type is an abstract construct that was introduced
for expediency and to simplify dealing with generic operands (operands whose types are type parameters).
In the Go compiler, code that in the past relied on the underlying type of an operand,
now instead had to call a function computing the operand’s core type.
In the language spec, in many places we just needed to replace “underlying type” with “core type”.
What’s not to like?Quite a few things, as it turns out!
To understand how we got here, it’s useful to briefly revisit how type parameters and type constraints work.Type parameters and type constraintsA type parameter is a placeholder for a future type argument;
it acts like a  whose value is known at compile time,
similar to how a named constant stands for a number, string, or bool whose value is known at compile time.
Like ordinary variables, type parameters have a type.
That type is described by their  which determines
what operations are permitted on operands whose type is the respective type parameter.Any concrete type that instantiates a type parameter must satisfy the type parameter’s constraint.
This ensures that an operand whose type is a type parameter possesses all of the respective type constraint’s properties,
no matter what concrete type is used to instantiate the type parameter.In Go, type constraints are described through a mixture of method and type requirements which together
define a : this is the set of all the types that satisfy all the requirements. Go uses a
generalized form of interfaces for this purpose. An interface enumerates a set of methods and types,
and the type set described by such an interface consists of all the types that implement those methods
and that are included in the enumerated types.For instance, the type set described by the interfacetype Constraint interface {
    ~[]byte | ~string
    Hash() uint64
}
consists of all the types whose representation is  or  and whose method set includes the  method.With this we can now write down the rules that govern operations on generic operands.
For instance, the rules for index expressions state that (among other things)
for an operand  of type parameter type :The index expression  must be valid for values of all types in ’s type set.
The element types of all types in ’s type set must be identical.
(In this context, the element type of a string type is .)These rules make it possible to index the generic variable  below (playground):func at[bytestring Constraint](s bytestring, i int) byte {
    return s[i]
}
The indexing operation  is permitted because the type of  is , and the type constraint (type set) of
 contains  and  types for which indexing with  is valid.This type set-based approach is very flexible and in line with the intentions of the
original generics proposal:
an operation involving operands of generic type should be valid if it is valid for any type permitted by the respective
type constraint.
To simplify matters with respect to the implementation, knowing that we would be able to relax rules later,
this approach was  chosen universally.
Instead, for instance, for Send statements, the spec states thatThe channel expression’s  must be a channel, the channel direction must permit send operations,
and the type of the value to be sent must be assignable to the channel’s element type.These rules are based on the notion of a core type which is defined roughly as follows:If a type is not a type parameter, its core type is just its underlying type.If the type is a type parameter, the core type is the single underlying type of all the types in the type parameter’s type set.
If the type set has  underlying types, the core type doesn’t exist.For instance,  has a core type (), but the  interface above does not have a core type.
To make things more complicated, when it comes to channel operations and certain built-in calls (, ) the above definition
of core types is too restrictive.
The actual rules have adjustments that allow for differing channel directions and type sets containing both  and  types.There are various problems with this approach:Because the definition of core type must lead to sound type rules for different language features,
it is overly restrictive for specific operations.
For instance, the Go 1.24 rules for slice expressions do rely on core types,
and as a consequence slicing an operand of type  constrained by  is not permitted, even though
it could be valid.When trying to understand a specific language feature, one may have to learn the intricacies of
core types even when considering non-generic code.
Again, for slice expressions, the language spec talks about the core type of the sliced operand,
rather than just stating that the operand must be an array, slice, or string.
The latter is more direct, simpler, and clearer, and doesn’t require knowing another concept that may be
irrelevant in the concrete case.Because the notion of core types exists, the rules for index expressions, and  and  (and others),
which all eschew core types, appear as exceptions in the language rather than the norm.
In turn, core types cause proposals such as issue #48522 which would permit a selector
 to access a field  shared by all elements of ’s type set, to appear to add more exceptions to the
language.
Without core types, that feature becomes a natural and useful consequence of the ordinary rules for non-generic
field access.For the upcoming Go 1.25 release (August 2025) we decided to remove the notion of core types from the
language spec in favor of explicit (and equivalent!) prose where needed.
This has multiple benefits:The Go spec presents fewer concepts, making it easier to learn the language.The behavior of non-generic code can be understood without reference to generics concepts.The individualized approach (specific rules for specific operations) opens the door for more flexible rules.
We already mentioned issue #48522, but there are also ideas for more powerful
slice operations, and improved type inference.The respective proposal issue #70128 was recently approved and the relevant changes
are already implemented.
Concretely this means that a lot of prose in the language spec was reverted to its original,
pre-generics form, and new paragraphs were added where needed to explain the rules as they
pertain to generic operands. Importantly, no behavior was changed.
The entire section on core types was removed.
The compiler’s error messages were updated to not mention “core type” anymore, and in many
cases error messages are now more specific by pointing out exactly which type in a type set
is causing a problem.Here is a sample of the changes made. For the built-in function ,
starting with Go 1.18 the spec began as follows:For an argument  with core type that is a channel,
the built-in function  records that no more values will be sent on the channel.A reader who simply wanted to know how  works, had to first learn about core types.
Starting with Go 1.25, this section will again begin the same way it began before Go 1.18:For a channel , the built-in function 
records that no more values will be sent on the channel.This is shorter and easier to understand.
Only when the reader is dealing with a generic operand will they have to contemplate
the newly added paragraph:If the type of the argument to  is a type parameter
all types in its type set must be channels with the same element type.
It is an error if any of those channels is a receive-only channel.We made similar changes to each place that mentioned core types.
In summary, although this spec update does not affect any current Go program, it opens the
door to future language improvements while making the language as it is today easier to
learn and its spec simpler.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson: Politics, Trump, AOC, Elon &amp; DOGE | Lex Fridman Podcast #462</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DTPSeeKokdo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 22:05:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ezra Klein is one of the most influential voices representing the left-wing of American politics.

The comparison has been a popular one, but the developers wanted to make it clear that this new IP from the creators of Sniper Elite is "its own thing for sure," and they're right. It is. But there are times when the similarities jump off the screen. Both focus on a post-apocalyptic world full of mutants, warring factions, and--most relatable of all--they both feature a sprawling locked bunker at the heart of their stories. But where the inciting incident in most Fallout games is  that bunker, Atomfall asks you to get inside its mysterious facility, The Interchange. It's in that simply stated objective that Atomfall's open-ended world design elevates the game to be something different and interesting in its own right, even as things like stealth and combat drag it down at times.Just as Atomfall's major brushstrokes are derivative of Fallout and other post-apocalyptic fiction, its story starts with a similar penchant for the cliche. You awaken as an amnesiac in a 1950s-set British countryside. A nearby phone booth rings, and the voice on the other side demands you destroy someone or something called "Oberon." That same voice will call back nearly each time you approach a phone booth in the wild. The cryptic messages don't make a bit of sense, but it does swiftly push you toward your objective: Find and get inside The Interchange, a locked-down facility of some sort that seems to have been the site of a science experiment gone wrong. In there, Oberon can perish, if you so choose.The region's people have been left to put the pieces back together following this event, and it's resulted in the forming of several opposing groups, such as the military force that claims authority, roaming bandits who use the chaos as an invitation to resort to lawlessness, and a cult of pagans who believe the catastrophe was . These territorial factions are often isolated to their own regions, which are experienced as a series of open-world maps that can be explored without limitations as soon as you start the game.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fresh Swap Features for Linux Users in Kubernetes 1.32</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature.
It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by
swapping out unused data,
shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes,
preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits,
and much more.
As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project
has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes.The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way
to GA in the near future.Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.
This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.
However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.
The Beta version was a drastic leap forward.
Not only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,
but it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests
which include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.
It also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the  behavior
which sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation
support (through the  endpoint) and Summary API for
VerticalPodAutoscalers (through the  endpoint), and more.Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.
Currently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,
enhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,
polishing the feature and making it stable.
For example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods
cannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.
In addition, the  behavior was removed since it might compromise
the node's health.
Secret content protection against swapping has also been introduced
(see relevant security-risk section for more info).To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled
is more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.
That said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.
In the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,
such as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the 
field must be set to  on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated
 command line flag must be deactivated.It is possible to configure the  option to define the
manner in which a node utilizes swap memory.
For instance,The currently available configuration options for  are: (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap. However, processes
outside of Kubernetes' scope, like system daemons (such as kubelet itself!) can utilize swap.
This behavior is beneficial for protecting the node from system-level memory spikes,
but it does not safeguard the workloads themselves from such spikes.: Kubernetes workloads can utilize swap memory, but with certain limitations.
The amount of swap available to a Pod is determined automatically,
based on the proportion of the memory requested relative to the node's total memory.
Only non-high-priority Pods under the Burstable
Quality of Service (QoS) tier are permitted to use swap.
For more details, see the section below.If configuration for  is not specified,
by default the kubelet will apply the same behaviour as the  setting.On Linux nodes, Kubernetes only supports running with swap enabled for hosts that use cgroup v2.
On cgroup v1 systems, all Kubernetes workloads are not allowed to use swap memory.Install a swap-enabled cluster with kubeadmIt is required for this demo that the kubeadm tool be installed, following the steps outlined in the
kubeadm installation guide.
If swap is already enabled on the node, cluster creation may proceed.
If swap is not enabled, please refer to the provided instructions for enabling swap.Create a swap file and turn swap onI'll demonstrate creating 4GiB of swap, both in the encrypted and unencrypted case.Setting up unencrypted swapAn unencrypted swap file can be set up as follows.Setting up encrypted swapAn encrypted swap file can be set up as follows.
Bear in mind that this example uses the  binary (which is available
on most Linux distributions).Verify that swap is enabledSwap can be verified to be enabled with both  command or the  command> swapon -s
Filename Type Size Used Priority

total used free shared buff/cache available
Mem: 3.8Gi 1.3Gi 249Mi 25Mi 2.5Gi 2.5Gi
Swap: 4.0Gi 0B 4.0Gi
After setting up swap, to start the swap file at boot time,
you either set up a systemd unit to activate (encrypted) swap, or you
add a line similar to /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 into .Set up a Kubernetes cluster that uses swap-enabled nodesTo make things clearer, here is an example kubeadm configuration file  for the swap enabled cluster.Then create a single-node cluster using kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml.
During init, there is a warning that swap is enabled on the node and in case the kubelet
 is set to true. We plan to remove this warning in a future release.How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant
challenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any
misconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific
workload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented
Swap with automatic configuration of limitations.With , Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.
/ QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.
 QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack
information regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe
allocation of swap memory.
Conversely,  QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the
precise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.
To maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,
these Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when  is in effect.
In addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory
they consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).: The container's memory request.Swap limitation is configured as:
(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) × totalPodsSwapAvailableIn other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its
memory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on
the node that is available for use by Pods.It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to
opt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.
Containers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.
When swap is already provisioned and available on a node,
the kubelet is able to be configured so that:It can start with swap on.It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory
to Kubernetes workloads by default.Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the
 in the KubeletConfiguration.
As a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the
presence of swap memory by setting .The kubelet employs the CRI
(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to
configure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as ) in a manner that will
enable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,
the container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.Node and container level metric statisticsKubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,
which can be accessed at the  (which is used mainly by monitoring
tools like Prometheus) and  (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.
This allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to
monitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using .
Additionally, a  metric has been added to cadvisor to show
the total physical swap capacity of the machine.
See this page for more info.Node Feature Discovery (NFD)Node Feature Discovery
is a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.
It can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,
use the following command:This will result in an output similar to:k8s-worker1: true
k8s-worker2: true
k8s-worker3: false
In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes  and , but not on .Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.
While swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data
back to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,
which can cause unexpected performance regressions.
Furthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.
Enabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,
where Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.
In addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,
and due to unexpected packing configurations,
the scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.
This heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.
When swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O
operations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with
I/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives
or NVMe.
As swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency
priority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the
recommended practices section below.On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as 
volume mounts, or  with )
are implemented with a  filesystem.
The contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should
not be swapped to disk.
To ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the  tmpfs option
is being used.The Linux kernel officially supports the  option from version 6.3 (more info
can be found in Linux Kernel Version Requirements).
However, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older
Linux versions as well.In order to verify whether the node supports the  option, the kubelet will do the following:If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the  option will be assumed to be supported.Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the  option at startup.
If kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option,  will be assumed
to not be supported, hence will not be used.
A kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.
If kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the  option will be used.
If the  option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,
then continue its execution.It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.
See the section above with an example for setting unencrypted swap.
However, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;
rather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.
It is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes clusterDisable swap for system-critical daemonsDuring the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance
of system-critical daemons and services might degrade.
This implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.
If this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice
to prevent swapping (i.e., set ).Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latencySwap can increase the I/O load on a node.
When memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,
system-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may
experience performance degradation.To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.
For non-systemd users,
setting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.
This can be achieved by setting  for the system slice,
thereby granting it higher I/O priority.
See cgroup's documentation for more info.Swap and control plane nodesThe Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.
The control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.
The main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.Use of a dedicated disk for swapIt is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.
If swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere
with system processes that need to write to disk.
When they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,
disrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.
Since swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.
Alternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,
paving the way for a feature GA.
However, this is just the beginning.
It's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,
including better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,
better debug abilities and more!You can review the current documentation
for using swap with Kubernetes.Feel free to reach out to me, Itamar Holder ( on Slack and GitHub)

In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs.Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters!Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t.Vulnerabilities Patched TodayFour of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets that are accessible to ingress-nginx. By default, ingress-nginx has access to all Secrets cluster-wide, so this can often lead to complete cluster takeover by any user or entity that has permission to create an Ingress.The most serious of today’s vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974, rated 9.8 CVSS, allows anything on the Pod network to exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities via the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. This makes such vulnerabilities far more dangerous: ordinarily one would need to be able to create an Ingress object in the cluster, which is a fairly privileged action. When combined with today’s other vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation.First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions.If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately.If you can’t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx.If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm
Reinstall, setting the Helm value controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=falseIf you have installed ingress-nginx manually
delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called edit the  Deployment or Daemonset, removing  from the controller container’s argument listIf you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect.Conclusion, thanks, and further readingThe ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe.Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revenge of the junior developer (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/137</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/137/changelog-news-137.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Steve Yegge’s latest rant about the future of “coding”, Ethan McCue shares some life altering Postgres patterns, Hillel Wayne makes the case for Verification-First Development, Gerd Zellweger experienced lots of pain setting up GitHub Actions & Cascii is a web-based ASCII diagram builder.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

In the middle of the capital, archaeologists are digging deep to find out more about the lives and deaths of the poorest of the poor, the inmates of the workhouse.  Behind the workhouse building lies a cemetery where they were buried - now it is being carefully excavated as the whole site is being redeveloped.  It’s a rare opportunity to investigate the treatment of London’s destitute in the late 18th and 19th centuries - a story that was repeated in great cities across the world as people poured into them in search of work.

Tony has a special connection with this story - not only has been making archaeology films for decades, he also appeared as a child actor in the first stage production of the musical, “Oliver!”.  He knows digging and he knows Dickens! He explores the finds from the excavations, from humble clay pipes to dissected skeletons revealing how dead inmates could be anatomised in the name of medical science.

This film combines unique archaeology, as well as social and literary history - the care of the poor, how their plight was brought to the attention of the public and the extreme challenges created by burgeoning cities. Dickens was writing about his times, but like all good history, the heart of it remains relevant today.

The Japanese phenom, Roki Sasaki, reunited with the growing list of his compatriots in Dodgers blue, making the World Series champions an even more formidable outfit. Corbin Burnes headed to the Arizona desert, the Cubs swung a trade for Kyle Tucker, and the Red Sox beefed up their rotation by acquiring ace Garrett Crotchet. It was an offseason of typical upheaval that even saw the Oakland Athletics leave their 57-year-old home for a temporary stay in Sacramento. But as the weather warms and spring training draws to a close, the return of the MLB season is just a few days away, which can only mean it's also time for the newest iteration of MLB The Show. While last year's game was one of minor iterations, MLB The Show 25 takes a few steps in the right direction by introducing a few long overdue changes to modes like Road to the Show and Franchise.Road to the Show (RTTS) has grown stale over the past couple of years, with little to no improvements and an irritating connection to the card-collecting mode, Diamond Dynasty. This isn't the case in The Show 25, as it severs that link and completely overhauls the opening few hours of your career with the addition of amateur baseball. Now, you begin your journey to the Major Leagues as a fresh-faced high school student. By playing well in the three available games, potentially winning a high school championship, and showcasing your talents at the MLB combine, you'll garner interest from both MLB teams and the eight different college programs included in the game, such as Vanderbilt, LSU, UCLA, and Texas. You can opt to sign with an MLB team straight out of high school as an 18-year-old--like previous years' games--or head to college for four years to further improve your attributes and, ideally, increase your draft stock.Each college has a rating from one to five stars in "exposure," which impacts your draft status and rating among scouts, and "skill development," which determines how many upgrade tokens you'll earn to improve your ballplayer. Once you've chosen a college that fits your needs, the game fast-forwards to your senior year as you prepare to compete in the College Baseball World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. Depending on the outcome of each game, you can potentially play in all four on the way to winning the national championship, which will significantly boost your standing in the draft if you also play well enough. After signing for an MLB team, you can expect to be fast-tracked through the minor leagues, as opposed to spending more time in AA and AAA if you decided to skip college, so there are some impactful choices to consider.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The First Berserker: Khazan Review - A Souls-Like That Packs A Punch</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-a-souls-like-that-packs-a-punch/1900-6418346/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Richard Wakeling</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/123/1239113/4464275-firstberserker.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The First Berserker: Khazan has all the familiar hallmarks of a souls-like--from a bonfire-esque checkpoint system that respawns enemies to XP you can lose upon death--yet its primary influences might not be what you would expect. While its parry-heavy combat is immediately reminiscent of From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, its level-based structure, weapon skills, and approach to gear are clearly inspired by Team Ninja's Nioh. Developer Neople has some ideas of its own, too, including a multifaceted progression system and cel-shaded art style that makes The First Berserker visually distinct from most of its contemporaries. As a result, this souls-like manages to feel familiar while also carving out an identity of its own, delivering a challenging yet rewarding experience that's anchored by a hard-hitting defensive style of combat and a degree of freedom in how you choose to play.In terms of story, you play as the eponymous Khazan. Once a legendary general famed for saving the empire from the fearsome Berserk Dragon, he's falsely branded a traitor at the game's outset. After being mercilessly tortured--with the tendons in both of his arms severed--and exiled to a mountainous, snowy tundra, our hero manages to escape and forms an unlikely alliance with a mysterious entity known as Blade Phantom, who grants Khazan otherworldly powers in his quest for revenge.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Next.js rocked by critical 9.1 level exploit...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaCnBOqyvIM</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AaCnBOqyvIM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:59:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get up to 67% off VPS at Hostinger.

"So I thought it would be worthwhile to make a guide for doing it on (relatively) inexpensive RK3588-powered single-board computers, using Box86/64 and Armbian."

The guides I came across were out of date, had a bunch of extra steps thrown in, or were outright incorrect... Up first, we need to add the Box86 and Box64 ARM repositories [along with dependencies, ARMHF architecture, and the Mesa graphics driver]... 
The guide closes with a multi-line script and advice to "Just close your eyes and run this. It's not pretty, but it will download the Steam Debian package, extract the needed bits, and set up a launch script." (And then the final step is sudo reboot now.) 

"At this point, all you have to do is open a terminal, type 'steam', and tap Enter. You'll have about five minutes to wait... Check out the video to see how some of the tested games perform."

At 720p, performance is all over the place, but the games I tested typically managed to stay above 30 FPS. This is better than I was expecting from a four-year-old SOC emulating x86 titles under ARM. 

Is this a practical way to play your Steam games? Nope, not even a little bit. For now, this is merely an exercise in ludicrous neatness. Things might get a wee bit better, considering Collabora is working on upstream support for RK3588 and Valve is up to something ARM-related, but ya know, "Valve Time"... 

"You might be tempted to enable Steam Play for your Windows games, but don't waste your time. I mean, you can try, but it ain't gonna work."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Immortal Final Recital of a Dying Pianist</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR-ihnTlGx0</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lR-ihnTlGx0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chopin Foundation: https://chopin.org
